The topic of this thesis is the assignment process and structure calculation by solid state NMR of outer membrane protein G (OmpG) from *E. coli* in its native lipid environment. The lipid bilayer is of great importance for the correct fold and functioning of membrane proteins. One of the advantages of solid-state NMR over other methods in structural biology is that this technique allows membrane proteins to be studied in its native environment. OmpG is a porin in the outer membrane of *E. coli*. Normally this porin is not expressed in *E. coli*. It was discovered in a studies were the genes for the most important porins for the uptake of sugar, LamB and OmpF, were deleted and a selection procedure was carried out to produce a strain that could grow on a maltodextrin medium. In contrast to most other porins, OmpG is a monomer. The protein has a molecular weight of 34 kDa, has 281 amino acid residues and forms a β-barrel composed of 14 strands. The sequence length of OmpG is larger than of most other proteins of which the structure is solved so far. Since the complexity of NMR spectra increases with the sequence length of the protein, this makes OmpG a challenging system, requiring development of new assignment strategies. Furthermore, it is important to benchmark the effectiveness of new NMR experiments, initially tested on micro-crystalline samples of small proteins, on a sample of a larger protein that is not of a micro-crystalline nature. These type of samples are more heterogeneous, which influences relaxation times. Under these conditions the set of requirements on pulse sequences changes.

First attempts to assign OmpG were made using ^13^C-detected spectra, as this was the most common detection method in solid-state NMR at the time this project started. To reduce spectral overlap and the ambiguity of cross-peak assignment, a set of specifically ^13^C labeled OmpG samples was produced. This set included samples were only a few amino acids at a time were labeled. The spectra recorded of these labeled samples offered a starting point for the sequential assignment. Other labeling schemes were based on the specific carbon labeling pattern obtained when glycerol labeled either on the first and third carbon positions (1,3-glycerol) or the second carbon position (2-glycerol) is used as a sole carbon source during protein expression. Combining the glycerol labeling method with a reverse labeling strategy, two more schemes could be produced, in which a specific set of amino acids was labeled following the 1,3- or 2-glycerol labeling pattern: 1,3- and 2-TEMPQANDSG and 1,3- and 2-SHLYGWAFV. These samples allowed the initial assignment to be extended. However, it was not possible to reach an assignment extend that allowed structure determination, using ^13^C-detected experiments alone.

In recent years, solid-state NMR has seen enormous progress. The combination of perdeuterated and partially back-exchanged protein samples with fast magic angle spinning has opened up the possibility to detect protons. Using this technique, a set of spectra could be recorded on perdeuterated and partially back-exchanged samples of OmpG, where all amino acids were ^15^N/^13^C-labeled. The set of ^1^H-detected experiments allows the assignment of the amide ^1^H and ^15^N, Cα and Cβ resonances and greatly simplifies the assignment strategy. Cα and Cβ chemical shifts obtained from ^1^H-detected spectra were used to find corresponding peak patterns in the ^13^C-detected spectra, giving access to side-chain ^13^C chemical shifts. The knowledge of side-chain ^13^C chemical shift results in more specific amino acid typing, which further facilitated the sequential assignment. Furthermore, cross-peaks in the ^13^C-detected spectra, provide extra prove that a sequential assignment is correct. This combined approach, using information from ^13^C- and ^1^H-detected spectra, the parts of the sequence corresponding to the membrane embedded β-barrel could be assigned.

Using these assignments and a set of through-space correlation experiments between carbons and between protons, the structure of OmpG in its native lipid environment could be calculated. Ambiguous distance restraints were disambiguated using the ambiguous restrain iterative assignment (ARIA) protocol. The final structure has a backbone rmsd of ~1.6 Å for the residues in the β-sheets and closely resembles the structure calculated before using solution NMR. The structure deviates from available crystal structures in the extra-cellular part of the protein. In this part of the protein, the structure calculated here shows large flexible loops, like in the solution NMR structure. In contrast, in the crystal structures the β-sheets are extended and on most strands, only small turns, instead of loops, remain. This can be explained by crystal contacts stabilizing the extended structure.

The progress made in the OmpG project allows further experiments that could give more insight in the pH-dependent opening and closing mechanism of the porin. Furthermore, the succesful structure determination of a membrane protein in its native lipid environment opens up the way to calculate structures of proteins under similar sample conditions.
