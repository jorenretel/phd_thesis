(Semi-) Automatic Assignment of Solid-State NMR spectra
=======================================================

Over the years a lot of different sequential assignment algorithms have been written. This is completely understandable since this is a completely deterministic problem, the kind computers are actually very good at solving. However, a lot of these scripts suffer from limitations that made them unsuitable to use in my project. None of the methods was able to correctly deal with 2- and 1,3-glycerol labeled samples, for instance. A more general problem is that most algorithms are implemented as stand-alone applications. This often invokes a complicated work-flow in which one has to export several peak and resonance lists from the program that is used to do the analysis of the NMR spectra and convert them to the format expected by the routine. Afterwards the results should be imported back into the analysis program so the result can be analyzed. This is not necessarily bad if it has to be done only be done once. However, for complex assignment projects, with a work-flow in which new data and assignments are added incrementally, this becomes cumbersome. Ironically, often these programs do not get used either for the less complicated assignment tasks since the expected payoff is lower for the user when the assignment can also be done by hand in a reasonable amount of time. Installing the program, converting a hand full of text files and having to check the results afterwards in a not so straight-forward way might be enough to scare off users that would potentially have gotten perfect results using an automatic assignment algorithm.

Also the type of data these stand-alone applications output is somewhat problematic. Often this is one possible sequential assignment that is the true one according to the program. In other words, there is little space for human interference. It would be great however to be able to compare the alternative assignments that the algorithm had to consider and cherry-pick the results for those assignments you actually believe are correct. Many of these problems can be easily overcome when the (semi-) automatic assignment algorithm is integrated within the analysis program. CCPN Analysis databases a lot of information that is relevant to an automatic assignment routine, that would often be lost in a export-import routine. The program has a great Application Programming Interface (API) that gives access to all information stored in the project by the user.

It was not the initial goal to write an assignment algorithm, but to create a tool that would help compare alternative assignment possibilities in a fast way. Because of the extensive use of different labeling schemes used in the assignment of OmpG the peaks that sequentially connect spin systems are often spread over a large amount of spectra. Therefor I needed a tool that would show me which peaks are expected in all differently labeled experiments for two sequential residues A and B. Furthermore the tool should then use the resonance information from all combinations of spin systems A' and B' with a residue type assignment that matches the types of residues A and B to cross check whether there are indeed peaks in the peak lists at the expected positions. The general idea is that the more sequential peaks present and the better these peaks fit the expected positions, the higher the likelihood that these two spin systems are indeed sequentially connected. The only method I could use before, was to plot rulers on the spectra at the resonance frequencies of the nuclei within a pair of spin systems A' and B'. Then the intersections of those rulers could be used to check whether there were the expected crosspeaks in different spectra. Of course this was too slow to systematically try out all combinations of spin systems over the whole sequence. Also, when this does not immediately result in a sequential assignment it is hard to remember or write down which combinations of spin systems fit together sequentially and to which extend. Therefor information can easily be lost and work has to be redone.

Of course, an application that compares different assignment possibilities for two sequential residues can easily be abstracted to the whole sequence. And this is what was done. A optimization procedure can be used to find out the optimal mapping between spin systems and residues. In figure {@fig:malandro_flow_diagram} an overview is given of the different steps in the algorithm, which are discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs.



#### 1. Input of data

 In the first step the input to the algorithm is gathered. In principle most information can be automatically loaded from the CCPN project:

* molecular topology
* labeling schemes
* experiment types describing the magnetization transfer pathway
* picked peaks
* spin systems
* shift lists
* assignment tolerances
* previously made sequential, tentative, and non-sequential amino acid type assignments

Not all information that is databased in the project has to be used necessarily. The user can choose which information is used and which is not. Excluding certain information can be practical when one wants to check a ready made assignment for instance. Spin systems in CCPN Analysis can basically have one of to following five levels of assignment: 1) The most definite form of assignment is of course when a spin system is sequentially assigned to a specific residue in the sequence. 2) One level of assignment lower, a spin system can be assigned 'tentatively' to multiple residues but it is not known which of those residues is the correct one. 3) Then there are spin systems that are residue typed, but no information about sequential assignment is present. 4) Also multiple residue types can be set for a residue. This option is not standardly accessible in the GUI of CCPN Analysis, but is present in the API and called ResidueTypeProbs. This is handy because often a residue type can be narrowed down to two very closely related residue types like asparagine and aspartic acid. 5) All the way at the bottom there are spin systems where not any form of sequential assignment nor residue type information is available.

In the part of the GUI shown in figure {@fig:malandro_gui}B it can be configured which of these different levels of assignment are used. If residue type information is not available or  not used, the residue typing algorithm already included in CCPN will be used to classify the spin systems to residue types. Because in most cases the classification is not definite, the user can set a threshold value above which all residue types will considered a possible.

There is one more type of assignments that can either be used or not by the algorithm, namely the assignment of peak dimensions to specific nuclei (resonances in CCPN). If this information is used, the only possible assignment of a peak dimension that is considered is the present assignment.

Furthermore the molecular chain to be used (the molecule) has to be selected. Optionally, parts of the chain that should not be considered for assignment can be entered. This last option can be used if it is clear that parts of the molecule can not be seen because of dynamics or for instance incomplete back-exchange of protons.

#### 2 Evaluate possible mapping between spin systems and residues

On the basis of the different levels of assignment describe above and which of that information should be used, for each spin system a set of possible residue assignments is created. Based on these sets, it can already be determined for each spin system with which other spin systems it could ever exchange sequential assignments in the Monte Carlo procedure later on. This information is used during the Monte Carlo procedure to pick which two spin systems to exchange. Also, at this stage 'joker' spin systems are introduced to make sure that always a spin system can be assigned to every residue. This is important since the Monte Carlo procedure was designed to select two spin systems and exchanging their residue assignments rather than the other way around, it is important that all residues always have a spin system assigned to them, because once that would not be case no spin system will ever be assigned to it.

#### 3 Predict peak pattern

The intra-residual and sequential peak patterns are predicted based on the molecular topology, the experiment graph and the isotope labeling scheme. Each spectrum in a CCPN project is connected to an experiment type. Normally, the user is prompted to set the experiment type for each new spectrum that is loaded into the CCPN project. When this was not done, it can be set afterwards and is essential for this algorithm to work. In the CCPN data model each experiment type is connected to an experiment graph. This graph describes which magnetization transfers happen during the experiment and how parts of the experiment map to dimensions in the spectrum. For each magnetization transfer information is present about which types of nuclei take part, whether the transfer is through-space or through-bond and whether a transfer from a nucleus to itself can happen. The specified atom types are not restricted to just isotopes but can be more specific, only aromatic carbons for instance. Together with the molecular topology, the graph can be walked recursively to generate a list of expected peaks for virtually any correlation experiment. This list is then filtered by the labeling scheme. For each peak the colabeling fraction over all nuclei on the magnetization transfer pathway is calculated. Only if the colabeling fraction exceeds a user defined variable the peak is retained. By default this minimal colabeling fraction is 0.1.


#### 4 Match predicted and real peaks

Now that a peak pattern is predicted for each spectrum, this can be matched with the peaks in the peak lists corrsponding to those spectra. The positions of the expected peaks can be determined using the chemical shifts assigned to resonances in the spin systems. Of course we don't know yet at this moment which spin systems is in which position on the sequence as that is the purpose of this algorithm. Therefor the possible mapping between residues and spin systems determined in step 2 is used. For every two sequentially neighboring residues A and B, all combinations of spin systems A' and B' are used to search the peak lists, see figure {@fig:malandro_peak_matching} A. The position of the expected sequential peaks will be different for each combination of A' and B'. To find out which peaks in the peaklists match to the expected pattern a chemical shift tolerance is used in each dimension of the spectrum. For each dimension of each spectrum a assignment tolerance can be set in CCPN Analysis, and those olerances are used here aswell.

The more of the expected sequential cross peaks are present in the peak lists, the likelier it is that a specific combination A'-B' is indeed a sequential pair. It is also important how well the actual peak positions fit the expected positions. To do this, for each matched peak a simple function is used that assigns an energy between 0 and -1 depending on the difference between cross-peak and expected peak position. That value is then multiplied with the square of the number of resonances involved with the expected peak to acknowledge that peaks in higher dimensional spectra carry more weight. This number is mostly equal to the number of dimensions, except for partially diagonal peaks. For instance the N~resonances~ for a diagonal peak in a NCOCX spectrum would be 2 instead of 3, which it should be since it contributes less prove for a sequential connection between two spin systems than an off-diagonal peak. Furthermore the energy is normalized by the symmetry of the spectrum the peak is in. A 2D ^13^C-^13^C correlation for instance has two sets of crosspeaks on each side of the diagonal, making the symmetry 2. All together the energy contribution of one peak can then be expressed as:

$$ E_{peak} = max(-1, \sum_{n=1}^{N_{d}} (\frac{\Delta\delta _{n}}{t_{n}}^2 - 1) \frac{1}{N_{d}(1-k^2)}) \frac{N_{resonances} ^2}{symmetry} $$

Where N~d~ is the number of dimensions, ∆δ~n~ is the difference between the shift of the peak and the shift from the shiftlist in the n-th dimension, t~n~ is the tolerance in the n-th dimension and k is the fraction of the tolerance window that has a flat bottom. This last value is set by default on 0.4.
The flat bottom was introduced to prevent over-interpreting small differences between the peak and the expected position. The energy then goes up gradually and becomes 0 for peaks that are all the way in the corner of the tolerance window, see figure {@fig:malandro_peak_matching} B.

As dicussed before chemical shifts can differ between spectra depending on the sample and experimental conditions such as temperature and isotope shifts. If these kind of differences are present it is important that spectra are connected to different shift lists. The correct shift list is then used by this algorithm to perform this matching step.

Besides from sequential cross-peaks, also intra-residual cross-peaks are matched. They do not play a role during the optimization of the sequential assignment as they carry no sequential information. However, it is useful to collect these peaks aswell, since they can be used for a quick assignment of peaks in new spectra to already known spin systems.
