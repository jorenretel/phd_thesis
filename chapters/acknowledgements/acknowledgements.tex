\chapter*{Acknowledgements}



I would like to thank all the people in some way involved in this project or in the lab. First of all I want to thank Matthias Hiller. In many ways we have a completely complementary approach to things, which was very much needed in this project. I feel that if there would not have been such a strong personal connection between us, these years would have been a whole lot less enjoyable. At least for me, and most likely for you as well. You always listened to me and always gave a balanced answer. I appreciate that incredibly. Next up is Andy Nieuwkoop. Your dedication and perfectionism really make a difference. This project would simply not have worked without someone like you, who really freaking cares. Besides that, I had a blast with you during those summer weeks in Lyon. We probably do not have time to return to the 'once upon a time, colour and pride' beer bar before you leave the continent but we should definitely go grab some Belgium beer soon. Probably we already did this by the time you are actually reading this. I would like to thank Vicky Higman for introducing me into the project those first months in 2010 and also for the helpful email correspondence whenever I was somehow completely stuck in the assignment process. Trent Franks, thank you for always helping me and the others out and for recording those first proton detected experiments on OmpG in Lyon. I guess you and Barth taught me more NMR during lunch and the beer hour than any text book. It is a pity we are not allowed to reference to 'mentioned by Trent at the beer hour'. I already mentioned Barth van Rossum who was also always there to help and to add some humor to all situations. I want to explicitly thank Barth, Matthias and Andy as well for proof reading this thesis. I would like to thank Liselotte Handel for preparing OmpG samples and always making time to help. Thank you, Benjamin Bardiaux, for answering my questions surrounding the structure calculation process and for implementing new features in ARIA that made the calculation a lot more straight-forward. I also want to thank you for being interested in my assignment algorithm, when you were still around in our lab. The fact that you thought it was a good idea convinced me that I should make the initial concept code into a more mature program. I would like to thank Anne Diehl for her supportive criticism.
Thanks to all people I shared an office with trough the years: Matthias Dorn, Tolga Helmbrecht, Anup Chowdhury, Anja Voreck, Wing Ying Chow and Masheed Sohrabi. From the old crew I also want to thank Sascha Lange, Arne Linden, Shakeel Ahmad Shahid, Stefan Marcovic, Monica Santos das Freitas and Marco RÃ¶ben. It was very kind of Sascha to show us (Trent, my wife and me) all the dirt tracks in northern Germany by taking the shortest route back home from Arne's wedding. Good times. Hartmut Oschkinat.


I would also really like to thank all the people in Lyon that were involved in this project: Emeline Barbet-Massin, Jan Stanek, Loren Andreas, Tanguy Le Marchand and Guido Pintacuda. It was always a pleasure coming over to Lyon, because the atmosphere in the group was always great. I will definitely return to Lyon just for fun and will let you know.

I am grateful to my parents, brother, grandparents and the rest of the family for the support and always showing interest from the sideline. It is a blessing to have such a warm family. People sometimes say I always look pretty relaxed. While sometimes that is not actually the case, they are right untill a certain extent and the reason for this is that I know    As my mom says: it is better to have children you only see a few times a year, but have a very solid relationship with, than to have children living next door that you can not stand. The same thing is true for parents.
