Structural Biology
==================

This thesis is about 'assignment methods for large proteins in solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ...'. Before bombarding you with details I would like to give a short introduction into the context of this research.

Nuclear magnetic resonance, or NMR, spectroscopy is a very standard method for the analysis of chemical substances. The general idea behind the technique is, like in any other form of spectroscopy, to measure a difference in energy between different states. In the case of NMR spectroscopy the different states are generated by bringing the sample in a large magnetic field. All atomic nuclei have a quantum mechanical property called 'spin'. In a magnetic field the spin of some atomic nuclei, for example the nucleus of the normal hydrogen 1H isotope, will be either pointed along the magnetic field or against it. The energy of the spins that are aligned with the magnetic field is slightly lower than that of those that are pointed against it. This is the energy difference that is exploited by NMR spectroscopy and leads to a signal in a NMR spectrum. The energy difference is directly related to the strength of the magnetic field. However the magnetic field that is perceived by a given spin is not only only determined by the external field of the magnet. Also the direct chemical environment around the spin influences the local magnetic field. Therefor every nucleus in a molecule that has a slightly different chemical environment gives rise to a peak on a different position in the spectrum. By careful analysis of these spectra, often combined with mass spectrometry, it has been possible for decades to determine the composition and structure of small organic molecules.
The use of NMR spectrometry in structural biology, which this thesis is about, is a little bit different. We generally already know the chemical composition of the molecule of interest. In case of a protein we know its amino acid sequence. In case of RNA or DNA we know the nucleotide sequence. Of course we also know the chemical composition of the amino acids and nucleotides respectively. The only missing information is the shape it adopts in three dimensional space and how this shape changes over time. Structural biology is essentially about reverse-engineering on a bio-molecular level. The central dogma in the field is that the structures of bio-molecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins can tell something about their function and how they fulfill this function. Of course this is interesting from a purely scientific point of view. However, understanding the biological mechanisms that are connected to diseases can help developing therapies.

The energy difference used in NMR is only very small compared to the thermal energy at biologically relevant temperatures. Therefor NMR is an inherently insensitive method. A measurable signal can only be generated by the measuring millions of molecules at the same time. As will be explained later, in one way or another all difficulties with this method lead back to this fact.

In both liquid and solid samples, every molecule in the sample has a different spacial orientation in respect to direction of the static field of the magnet.

Membrane Proteins
=================

The lipids in a biological membrane are very diverse and differ between organisms and cell types. The membrane is very crowded with membrane proteins, often the amount of protein (in terms of weight) is larger than the amount of lipids. In E. coli membranes 75 weight percent can be attributed to proteins (Lehninger). The lipids in the two leaflets that compose the lipid bilayer are often distinct. This is also the case in the outer membrane of E. coli. The outer leaflet is composed of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and the inner leaflet of the more usual phospholipids. This influences the membrane thickness, which is with 24 Ã… a little thinner than would be expected....


In general membrane proteins can be divided in several classes, 7 transmembrane, beta-barrel....

The topology of membrane proteins can often be predicted based on the residue sequence. For instance, 20 or more hydrofobic residues is a row is quite likely to form a transmembrane helix. Also other types of residues give a hint to the topology of a membrane protein. For instance tryptophan residues are often found at the interface between the transmembrane and the non-transmembrane part of the protein since they have a large flat aromatic ring system....

Sequential Assignment of solid state NMR spectra
================================================

In most NMR studies very little can be done before the chemical shifts of the nuclei that are interesting in the context of the biological question. Sometimes those are only a few. However if the goal is to calculate the structure and study the overall dynamics of the protein a fairly complete mapping between resonance frequencies and nuclei in the molecule has to be present. This mapping process is referred to as sequential assignment and often is the most time consuming part of an NMR studies. The general idea behind sequential assignment methodologies is always the same: the graph that arises from a set of correlation spectra is mapped on the molecular topology. In case of proteins this process is aided by the fact that different amino acids have different combinations of chemical shifts. Therefor the residue type of a set of signals that belongs to one residue can be narrowed down to a few or sometimes even one type of amino acid. First a signal pattern that belongs to a set of sequentially connected amino acids is found. Then, mostly, this pattern can be mapped to a subsequence in the protein.

From now on I will call the collection of resonances that belongs to one residue a spin system. The words spin system is often used in NMR in a somewhat less confined sense, meaning a set of resonances that are in some way influenced by one another. However, since this thesis will deal with sequential assignment for a large extent, I will use the term in the more strict sense, as it is also used in the CCPNMR Analysis software package that is used to analyze NMR spectra.



![Percentage of subsequences that is only present in the sequence once. Purple, orange and green correspond to subsequences of length 1,2 and 3 respectively. This plot is made using 1000 membrane protein sequences from the uniProt database. Every point represents one protein. As expected, the amount of single amino acids that only appear in the sequence once very quickly drops of with increasing sequence length. At the other side, even for the largest proteins still more than half of all triplets (subsequences of length 3) is completely unique in the sequence. Of course, the fact that the subsequence is unique does not necessarily mean that the subsequence can be distinguished from all other subsequences based on the chemical shifts of these residues. That also heavily depends on how many 13C chemical shifts of the spin systems are known, which is directly dependent on the type of spectra recorded.  \label{unique_subsequences}](figures/amount_of_unique_subsequences.svg)



## Assignment Using ^13^C-detected Spectra

At moderate spinning rates and fully protonated samples it is not possible to detect protons in a useful manner in the solid state since the linewidths are very large due to the strong dipolar coupling network between protons. Therefor until very recently assignments where done almost exclusively using ^15^N and ^13^C chemical shifts.

Colored (green, orange and purple) clusters of rectangles indicate that a sequential walk is possible without using the more congested spectra of non-residue specific labeling schemes. A sequential walk is possible when two sequential residues are co-labeled in at least one labeling scheme. Grey rectangles indicate that the residue is not co-labeled with any of its two neighboring residues. The average cluster length is 3.0 and on average a given residue is part of a cluster of length 5.5.  \label{labeling_schemes_on_ompg_sequence}](figures/labelling_schemes_on_ompg_sequence.png)

## Assignment Using ^1^H-detected Spectra

Recently the use of higher MAS rates of 40 and 60 kHz, and even higher spinning rates have become technically achievable. In combination with samples that are expressed in fully deuterated medium and where the exchangeable sides are subsequently back-exchanged with a chosen percentage of protons, this allows protons to be detected. This opens up the possibility to do NMR experiments that are conceptually very comparable to solution NMR experiments.

The solution spectrum is a modified copy of the second figure in the paper of Lukas K. Tamm and coworkers describing the solution structure of OmpG. [@Liang2007] The solution spectrum was recorded using a TROSY-HSQC sequence. Besides the obvious difference in line-width between the two spectra, there are also peaks present in the solution spectrum that are absent in the solid state spectrum. These peaks correspond mostly to the flexible loops on the extra-cellular side of OmpG and some to the shorter turns on the intra-cellular side.](figures/HN_solid_solution.png)

## Connecting Carbon and Proton Detected Assignments and Isotope Shift

The most straight-forward approach to sequential assignment would be to first finish the backbone and CÎ² chemical shift assignment using the ^1^H detected strip matching approach described earlier, and afterwards find the ^13^C side-chain chemical shifts using ^13^C-detected spectra. However, it is very handy to already connect spin systems that are made in the proton and carbon detected data during the sequential assignment process, if possible. The ^13^C chemical shifts found in the ^1^H detected spectra can easily be used to find the CÎ±-CÎ² cross peak 2D ^13^C-^13^C correlation spectra. If there is enough dispersion in the ^13^C-^13^C spectrum the peak can be easily found and from there the rest of the ^13^C chemical shifts of the side-chain. Having found side chain chemical shifts makes residue typing a lot more exclusive. Thereby mapping a series of otherwise ambiguous strips to a stretch in the sequence becomes possible. Also, sequential crosspeaks in the ^13^C-^13^C correlation can reinforce the certainty that two strips really fit together sequentially.

A very similar approach is taken in solution NMR when TOCSY spectra are used to find the side-chain ^1^H chemical shifts. Often this happens after the entire back-bone has already been assigned, it can however also aid the assignment process itself by facilitating residue typing.

Because ^13^C detected and ^1^H detected spectra are typically recorded using different samples (fully protonated and deuterated/back-exchanged respectively) the ^13^C chemical shifts can be shifted by up to a full ppm. Therefor a correction for this deuterium isotope shift has to be performed. This deuterium shift has been described before and quantified by solution NMR spectroscopists [@Hansen1988][@Venters1996][@Maltsev2012]. The magnitude of the shift can be approximated by the following equation:

$$\Delta C(D) =  ^{1}\Delta C(D)d _{1} + ^{2}\Delta C(D)d _{2} + ^{3}\Delta C(D)d _{3}$$ {#eq:isotope_shift}

Here *d~1~*, *d~2~* and *d~3~* are the amount of deuterons one, two and three bonds away from the carbon nucleus of interest. For all amino acid types, except Glycine, more deuterons are surrounding the CÎ² than the CÎ± and therefor the CÎ² shifts are more affected. Both *Venters et al.* and *Maltsev et al* determined the factors ^i^Î”C(D) experimentally, but got different values [@Venters1996][@Maltsev2012]. As argued by *Maltsev et al.* this is just a estimate, as the real values also heavily depend on the local structure. Indeed the study of *Maltsev et al.* used Î±-synuclein, which is an intrinsically disordered protein where *Venters et al.* used human carbonic anhydrase I, which is mostly Î²-sheet with some small Î±-helices.

Anyway, the values found by these studies can be used to be in the right ball park and will in most cases be good enough to connect the resonances in proton and carbon detected spectra. A more exact calculation of the isotope shift does not seem possible for now and if possible in the future it will most probably involve at least secondary structure information like Ï† and Ï‡ angles, which are most likely not known at the stage of sequential assignment.

Whether it is easier to first sequentially assign a strip in the ^1^H detected data to a residue and then find its ^13^C detected counterpart completely depends on the situation. If the CÎ±-CÎ² combination is very unique, i.e. corresponding to an uncrowded part of the 2D ^13^C-^13^C correlation, it is of course easier to find the correct ^13^C detected spin system first since the improved residue typing helps sequential assignment.

However, if the CÎ±-CÎ² combination corresponds to a very crowded area of the 2D ^13^C-^13^C correlation, it can often be easier to first do the sequential assignment of the spin system purely based on matching strips in the ^1^H-detected spectra and looking at the remaining possibilities. Of course finding the i+1 strip is also harder for very degenerate CÎ±-CÎ² combinations, but at least the peak positions in the ^13^C dimensions of the matching strips should fit a lot better because of the lack of   isotope shift between different spectra recorded using the same sample. Also, if you are not too unlucky, the N-H combination will not be degenerate, in which case the CAcoNH and CBcacoNH peaks can help you find the i-1 strip or at least give you a good idea about the possible residue types of the i-1 spin system.

After the sequential assignment is done, it is a lot easier to find the corresponding ^13^C-detected spin systems since now the residue type is known, which limits the choice between possible spin systems. Because now often also a neighboring spin system is known the exact CÎ± and CÎ² chemical shift in the ^13^C detected data can be determined if the intra-residual CÎ±-CÎ² crosspeak is part of a blob. This is possible by looking for the sequential CÎ²-CÎ², CÎ±-CÎ²... etc. crosspeaks. Also cross-peaks to the rest of the side-chain ^13^C shifts can be used at that point to find the correct spin system.

Especially for this last order of events (first assigning the spin system sequentiall and finding the side-chain ^13^C shifts later) having residue specifically labeled samples will help enormously. If the sequential assignment is known, it is clear which labelled samples can be used to find the side-chain shifts for a particular spin system.In practice, it will not be so clear which strategy you will be using sing you will be using both at the same.

During the assignment process you will very likely end up with two sets of spin systems, one from the ^1^H detected data and one from the ^13^C detected data. Also, in CCPN Analysis ^1^H- and ^13^C-detected spectra should be connected to separate shift lists to prevent internally averaging the two shifts into one main shift. This would be very unhandy for all parts of the program that rely on shift matching in some way. To make the process of matching up and merging the two sets of spin systems I wrote a simple CCPN analysis plug-in, see figure {@fig:compare_spin_systems_gui}. Any two spin systems can be compared to one another. As a measure of how comparable the two spin systems are, the euclidean distance between the corresponding shifts is calculated. If the shifts from protonated and deuterated samples are indeed divided into two different shift lists, a correction based on the values reported by *Maltsev et al.* can be performed. This tool can be useful in other cases where spin systems have to be compared. It can be downloaded at <https://github.com/jorenretel/compare_spinsystems>.

The three tables at the bottom show the resonances unique to the first spin system, the resonances that are assigned to the same type of nuclei and the resonances unique to the second spin system respectively. In this case a spin system created based on the proton detected data (left side) is compared to one that was created using carbon detected data (right side).](figures/compare_spin_systems_gui.png) {#fig:compare_spin_systems_gui}
