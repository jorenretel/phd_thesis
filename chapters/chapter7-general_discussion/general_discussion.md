General Discussion and Outlook
==============================

The goal of these studies was to develop a new solid-state NMR methodology for the structure determination of membrane proteins in native lipid bilayers. OmpG serves as a good model system for the development of such new methods. Because of its size and the non-crystalline nature of the sample. It provides the challenges that make it necessary to explore different strategies for sequential assignment and structure calculation.

Different labeling strategies were explored to be able to achieve sequence-specific assignments using ^13^C-detected experiments. This strategy gave access to a "starting assignment". However, the use of ^1^H-detected experiments was absolutely necessary to arrive at a complete assignment of the folded part. The assignment strategy based on ^1^H-detected experiments turned out to be more robust since the addition of an independent nucleus and thereby a spectral dimension contributed enormously to the dispersion of the signals.

The successful application of ^1^H-detection to a variety of systems, among which OmpG, already caused ^1^H-detection to become more common and will undoubtedly become the standard detection method in solid-state NMR within the next few years. 3 years ago only a few laboratories owned an ultra fast spinning probe, however, now the field is quickly adapting. Still, the methodology requires further improvements. For example, it would be interesting to compare 3D spectra recorded with different ^13^C-^13^C transfer methods, as it seems that a substantial amount of signal is lost during the scalar coupling based methods used so far in this project. Sequences optimized for proteins with short T~2~ need to be developed. Furthermore, ^1^H-detected experiments that give access to sidechain chemical shifts should be tested. In our case, it was possible to assign OmpG ^13^C sidechain chemical shifts with the aid of ^13^C-detected experiments that made use of a completely different set of isotope labeled samples as those that were used for the ^1^H-detected experiments. It would be favorable to only use one sample to obtain the spectra necessary for the sequential assignment and the assignment of sidechain chemical shifts. As discussed in chapter 4, a number of different ^1^H-detected approaches have been developed to access sidechain chemical shifts. However, more experiments are necessary to evaluate approach is most effective for a membrane protein preparation like OmpG.

For the structure calculation it was very important that the restraint sets based on ^1^H-detected and ^13^C-detected experiments could enter the calculation at different stages. In addition, restraint combination was crucial to minimize the negative effect of ambiguous restraints that did not contain the correct assignment option. Because OmpG is a β-barrel, ^1^H-^1^H restraints between amide groups in the backbone play a large role in defining the contacts between the individual β-strands. Therefore, the correct topology of the strands is already found in the first iteration of the ARIA protocol. This in turn restricts the assignment options of the ^13^C-^13^C restraints that enter the calculation at a later stage. When determining the structure of proteins with other topologies, restraints between sidechains are more important for finding the correct relative orientation between different structural elements. In this case, the structure calculation protocol described here, using only ^1^H-^1^H restraints between exchangeable protons in the first iterations, may need to be modified. To be able to let the ^13^C-^13^C restraints enter the calculation in the very first iteration, the fraction of assigned ^13^C chemical shifts should be higher. An alternative would be to measure ^1^H-^1^H restraints between labeled methyl groups. Yet another option would be to use even higher MAS rates, so that fully protonated protein samples can be studied.

The use of fully protonated proteins and faster MAS frequencies (~100 kHz) might also be necessary for proteins that can not (in contrast to OmpG) be easily refolded. In these proteins, the exchange of deuterons by protons within secondary structure elements will not be efficient as all amide protons will be involved in a hydrogen bond. It might be an option to exploit deuterium double quantum chemical shifts in this case.

Besides using OmpG as a system to further improve solid-state NMR methodology, the derived structure is of high interest with regards to addressing some of the open questions surrounding the pH-dependent opening and closing mechanism of this porin. The derived structure, like the solution structure, contains large flexible loops on the extra-cellular side. This contrasts with the crystal structures for which the β-sheet extends far beyond the membrane interface, stabilized by crystal contacts. It could be investigated whether more signals, and therefore more structure content, are present in spectra of OmpG mutants for which the spontaneous gating is minimized, as described in the general introduction.

During the assignment process, which was by far the most time consuming part of these studies, it was important to be aided by good software. For this reason, the comprehensive data model provided by CCPNMR was of great value. Furthermore, it is very important to be able to get a fast overview of the assignments that have been made and of those that are still missing. Because methodologies in solid-sate NMR are quickly evolving, the possibility to extend CCPNMR Analysis by writing macros is very useful. This can be used to provide computational tools that fit newly developed methodology. The plug-ins for CCPNMR Analysis written in the context of these studies proved to be very helpful during the assignment process.
