Structure Calculation
=====================

The restraints used in the structure calculation of OmpG can exist of two types: torsion angle restraints that are based on chemical shifts of the residues and distances restraints based on crosspeaks in through-space correlation spectra. This second group of restraints can in turn be subdivided into a group of distance restraints obtained from ^1^H-detected experiments and another group that is based on ^13^-detected experiments.


## Torsion Angle Restraints

Torsion angles where predicted using the program TALOS+ [@cornilescu_protein_1999][@shen_talos_2009]. In figure {@fig:secondary_structure_and_topology_prediction} the secondary structure that correponds to these torsion angles by TALOS+ is shown along the OmpG sequence. Of course a prediction based on chemical shifts is only possible for assigned residues. As expected the largest part of the assigned residues are predicted to be in a β-sheet conformation. These results can also be compared to a prediction of the topology done purely on the basis of the amino acid sequence by the program called PRED-TMBB [@bagos_predtmbb_2004]. This tool is specifically designed for β-barrel and predicts which part of the molecule is part of the transmembrane β-sheet, intra-cellular turn and extra-cellular loop. Because the algorithm is based on machine learning, we send the author of the program an email to verify that previously calculated OmpG structures were not part of the training data, which was not the case. It can be observed that the to prediction align fairly well. Where PRED-TMBB predicts a turn, the chemical shifts are more coil-like. In these turns also a lower RCI-S2 value can be observed, indicating a less ordered part of the molecule. The missing assignments cluster largely in the extra-cellular loops.

## Restraints based on ^1^H-detected through-space correlation experiments

To get a good set of restraints, through space correlations where acquired on the perdeuterated samples, where the exchangeable sites where 100% back-exchanged for protons. The same type of sample that was used to acquire part of the proton-detected experiments needed for sequential assignment discussed earlier. Two spectra where recorded: an hNHH and an hNhhNH, both using cross-polarization for transfers between proton and nitrogen and a 2 ms radio frequency driven recoupling (rfdr) sequence for the transfer between the protons.
Since most of the proton sites in the molecule are deuterated, most peaks present in these spectra are peaks correlating one amide group to another. In both spectra strips can be drawn at the ^15^N and ^1^H chemical shifts of one amide group. In general such strips contain, besides a diagonal peak, one big and often one or two smaller crosspeaks. In the hNHH these peaks correlate a given amide group to a close-by proton and in the hNhhNH the amide group is correlated to a nitrogen of a close NH-group. Since the correlation pathway of the latter experiment makes sure that both intacting protons are part of an NH-group this spectrum is a little bit cleaner. If both spectra are considered together there are four peaks indicating the proximity of two NH groups. An example of such a group of four peaks correlating two amide groups is shown in figure {@fig:through_space_proton_detected_strips_Tyr76_Leu88}. In the case of an anti-parallel β-sheet, the biggest off-diagonal peak is almost always correlating two amide groups facing each other from neighboring strands in the sheet. These two residues are involved in two hydrogen bonds between each other's carbonyl-oxygens and amide protons. On average the two amide protons are only 3.1 Å separated from one another, see figure {@fig:distances_in_antiparallel_betasheet}B. The smaller peaks are often correlations to the amide groups of the neighboring residues in the same strand or to the amide group of the residue after the directly hydrogen bonded residue. As can be seen in {@fig:distances_in_antiparallel_betasheet}, a very specific alternating pattern of cross-peaks is expected connecting two strands in the β-sheet, skipping the residues in between which in turn are pointing towards the neighboring strand on the other side. The mixing time of 2 ms is relatively short, so that it was possible to distinguish between the short over-the-strand correlations and the ones a little bit further. The optimal mixing time was determined by taking several 2D hNhH with different mixing times. Some peaks that are well separated in the NH correlation, like the 113 Tryptophan and 155 Glutamic acid peaks, could be used to monitor the relative sizes of the main cross-peak and the smaller ones. At longer mixing times the smaller cross-peaks would increase in size, while the main cross-peak would get smaller. Since the smaller cross-peaks are often sequential, and therefor of little structural value, we chose to run the 3D experiments with a mixing time that gave maximum intensity for the main cross-peaks.

Because of chemical shift degeneracy, most cross-peaks can not be assigned unambiguously. Therefor ambiguous distance restraints (ADRs) were generated that will be disambiguated during the course of the structure calculation with ARIA. Each ADR basically consists of a list of possible assignments of a cross-peak in the spectrum. These assignment options are referred to as restraint items.

Which assignments are possible for each peak is determined by a set of chemical shift tolerances. These tolerances were set to 0.4 ppm for the ^15^N dimensions, 0.1 ppm for the indirectly detected ^1^H dimensions and 0.07 ppm for the directly detected ^1^H dimensions. The slightly smaller tolerance on the directly directed acquired dimension is possible because this dimension is better digitized. When using these tolerances directly, the 'bucket' around the actual peak position in which assignments are accepted is square or cubical depending on the dimensionality. When considering the chemical shifts for each dimension together, in the corners of this square a combination of chemical shift that is still accepted as a possible assignment is further away from the actual peak position as a combination that is closer to one of the mid-lines of the square. In other words, when using tolerances like this on a multidimensional spectrum, restraint items are created where all chemical shifts are really far away from the actual peak position. When assigning a peak by hand these kind of combinations would probably be discarded as they are way less likely to be correct as a combination where only one of the dimensions is close to the edge of the tolerance. To correct for this behavior of 'square' tolerance windows, an extra rule was applied. In both the hNHH and the hNhhNH, 2 out of 3 dimensions directly correspond to one bonded NH pair and therefor these 2 chemical shifts can be considered together when mapping chemical shifts to peak positions. In practice the euclidean distance between the peak position and the combination of the ^15^N and ^1^H chemical shifts normalized by the shift tolerances is calculated. All assignment options that are closer than half of the maximum distance in the tolerance square are accepted indiscriminately. All assignment options that are outside of this circle are only accepted when there is not an assignment option that is twice closer to the actual peak position, see figure {@fig:round_tolerance}. On the dimension of the through space correlated nucleus this rule was not applied.

These distances are normalized by the shift tolerances. Within the turquoise circle, corresponding to half of the distance between the peak position and the corners of the square, all possible assignments (A and B) are accepted. Outside of this circle assignment possibilities are only accepted in the absence of an assignment possibility twice closer to the peak position. For instance option C would only be accepted if A would not be present.](figures/round_tolerance.svg){#fig:round_tolerance}




There are in principle four crosspeaks that correlate the same two amide groups. This redundancy can easily be used to decrease the ambiguity of automatically generated ADRs even further, already before the structure calculation. A ccpnmr macro script was used to determine for which items of each ADR all 4 peaks were present (giving rise to three other ADRs that also have the correlation between these amide hydrogens as one of their items). For restraints that had one or more of such items, all other items that had a 'symmetry' of 2 or less (instead of 4) were removed. When applying this operation and plotting the generated restraints on a residue interaction matrix the pattern expected for β-sheets, lines of interaction perpendicular to the diagonal, can already be seen by eye. In principle an assignment of the crosspeaks could be made by hand, we decided however to directly feed the ambiguous restraints to ARIA and let it further disambiguate the restraints during the structure calculation.  



## Restraints based on ^13^C-detected through-space correlation experiments

Another set of distance restraints comes from a set of ^13^C-detected experiments that where also used for the assignment. All spectra that where used where 2D 13^C^-^13^C correlations with 400 ms DARR mixing. Several spectra with good dispersion and signal to noise where selected to create distance restraints. Peaks were picked in the parts of the aliphatic region that were well dispersed. The regions with a lot of peak overlap were avoided since the maxima of peaks in those regions are not necessarily at the right position for one specific cross-peak but is determined by all the underlying peaks. Restraints were produced by shift-matching with a tolerance of 0.4 ppm in both dimensions and only assignment possibilities were generating where the co-labeling fraction of the two correlated carbons exceeded 0.1.
