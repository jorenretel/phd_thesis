Assignment Using ^1^H-detected Experiments
==========================================

## Introduction


There are good reasons to detect ^1^H as opposed to ^13^C, which was the most common detection method in solid-state NMR until recently. Since the gyromagnetic ratio of ^1^H is 8 and 31 times than those of ^13^C and ^15^N respectively, the signal to noise in proton detected spectra is higher. In addition, protons add an additional observable nucleus, which provides an independent dimension to multi-dimensional spectra, increasing resolution and making assignment strategies more robust. Because the application of solid-state NMR to biological samples is always sensitivity limited, proton detection was badly needed to make larger systems accessible. The major challenge with the inclusion of protons is their large linewidth caused by the strong ^1^H-^1^H dipolar couplings (see table {@tbl:dipolar_coupling_constants}). There are two main strategies that can be employed to reduce the ^1^H linewidths:

1. Reduction of the amount of ^1^H in the sample by perdeuterating the protein and subsequently reintroduction of small amounts of protons at the exchangeable sites, see figure {@fig:deuteration}.
2. Spinning of small diameter rotors (<2 mm) at higher MAS frequencies (>40 kHz).

Right: the perdeuterated protein from the figure in the middle after the back-exchange procedure, as used in ^1^H-detected experiments. In the case of the OmpG samples, the back-exchange procedure is performed before refolding. By choosing the H~2~O:D~2~O ratio in the buffer a defined proton content can be obtained at the exchangeable sites.](figures/deuteration.svg){#fig:deuteration}


Early proton-detected experiments were performed on dipeptides and small proteins using the first strategy [@reif_1h1h_2001][@reif_1h_2003][@chevelkov_1h_2003][@paulson_sensitive_2003]. It was shown that by drastically reducing the amount of back-exchanged protons from 100% to 10% ^15^N-^1^H correlation spectra of the small protein SH3 could be acquired with high resolution [@chevelkov_ultrahigh_2006]. Experiments employing proton detection enabled the assignment of backbone ^1^H, ^15^N and ^13^C resonances which, in combination with restraints obtained from additionally protonated methyl groups, yielded the structure of SH3 at low back-exchange levels (10 and 25% respectively) and moderate MAS rates [@linser_protondetected_2008][@linser_structure_2011]. The optimal amount of reprotonation at 24kHz MAS was found to be around 30% [@akbey_optimum_2009]. A first ^15^N-^1^H correlation of OmpG was measured at this back-exchange level and 20kHz MAS [@linser_protondetected_2011].

Recently, probes spinning small diameter rotors at faster MAS rates (40-60kHz) have become commercially available. At these high spinning rates, high-resolution spectra can be recorded with full reprotonation of the exchangeable sites of otherwise perdeuterated proteins [@zhou_protondetected_2007][@lewandowski_enhanced_2011]. Although the sample volume in these rotors is smaller, loss of signal to noise is balanced by several factors. First of all, the higher content of exchanged protons increases the number of protons available for detection. Second, the filling factor of the coils for smaller rotors plays a role. For instance, ^15^N-^1^H correlations of SH3 measured in 1.9 mm rotors spinning at 40 kHz with 60% back-exchanged protons and in 1.3 mm rotors spinning at 60 kHz with 100% back-exchanged protons are very similar both in signal to noise and resolution. However, for 3D experiments that contain a scalar transfer step, the signal to noise ratio in the 1.3 mm rotors is higher [@nieuwkoop_sensitivity_2015].
At ultra-fast spinning conditions low power hetero-nuclear decoupling can be used, which reduces strain on the instrumentation and sample heating [@ernst_lowpower_2001][@kotecha_efficient_2007][@laage_fast_2009]. Furthermore, ^1^H-^13^C cross-polarization conditions become available that selectively transfer magnetization to either the carbonyl or aliphatic carbons [@laage_bandselective_2008].

Various groups have introduced experiments employing proton detection to acquire sequential assignments and have applied them successfully to a number of different systems: micro-crystalline (SH3, GB1, Human Superoxide Dismutase, DsbA and β2m), α-synuclein fibrils, sedimented viral capsids, a secretion needle from salmonella and membrane proteins (the conductance domain from influenza A M2, and DsbB) [@zhou_solidstate_2007][@knight_fast_2011][@barbet-massin_rapid_2014][@zhou_solidstate_2012][@chevelkov_protondetected_2014]. Also structures have been calculated using ^1^H-^1^H distances acquired at fast MAS, for example GB1 and Human Superoxide Dismutase  [@zhou_solidstate_2007][@knight_fast_2011][@knight_structure_2012].

For the assignment of OmpG, two sets of three types of experiments were recorded, as illustrated in figure {@fig:assignment_experiments_proton_detected}, at 60 kHz MAS. These are the pulse sequences presented in the papers of Barbet-Massin et al. in 2013 and 2014 [@barbet-massin_outandback_2013][@barbet-massin_rapid_2014]. The first set, consisting of the hCANH, hCOcaNH and hcaCBcaNH experiments, correlates each ^1^H-^15^N pair in the backbone to the chemical shift of the Cα, CO and Cβ respectively, within the same residue. The second set correlates the ^1^H-^15^N pairs to the Cα, CO and Cβ frequencies of the preceding residue. To achieve the sequential assignments, strips are generated corresponding to the chemical shifts of one ^1^H-^15^N pair. By finding two strips in which the ^13^C chemical shifts from the first set of spectra match the ^13^C chemical shifts of the second set, a sequential connection can be established. When several strips are placed in order, a match to a part of the protein sequence can be found, based on the possible amino acid types that are allowed for the combinations of Cα and Cβ chemical shifts.

The hcoCAcoNH, hCOcaNH, hcaCBcaNH and hcaCBcacoNH pulse sequences make use of scalar-coupling based transfer steps to transfer magnetization between the carbons. To evolve the scalar coupling, relatively long delays τ of 1/(4J~CC~) are needed. This equals 4.5 ms for a Cα-CO and 7.1 ms for a Cβ-Cα transfer (with J~CαCO~=55Hz and J~CαCβ~=35Hz). For the transfer of magnetization between the CO and Cα in the hcoCAcoNH and the Cα and Cβ in the hcaCBcaNH and hcaCBcacoNH experiments out-and-back schemes are used [@barbet-massin_outandback_2013]. This means that instead of using a CP transfer directly from proton to the carbon measured in one of the indirect dimensions (which would be the case in hCAcoNH, hCBcaNH and hCBcacoNH experiments), the magnetization is transferred first to the neighboring carbon on the magnetization transfer pathway. Both the out-and-back and 'normal' variant of the experiment contain 4 delays τ. The advantage of the out and back scheme is that the transverse magnetization during these delays is on the slower relaxing nucleus (Cα in the case of a Cα-Cβ transfer and CO in the case of a Cα-CO transfer) instead of on each nucleus for 2 out of 4 delays. Only just before the acquisition of the carbon dimension, the spin of the faster relaxing nucleus is brought into the transverse plane. Because of the inhomogeneous nature of the sample ^13^C T~2~ times are shorter in OmpG than in more structured proteins. The bulk T~2~ time for Cα was measured to be around 8 ms. The CO T~2~ was not measured but is likely to be a factor of 3-4 larger. Therefore this experimental scheme dramatically increased the sensitivity of these experiments.

This set of spectra is conceptually very similar to the basic set of spectra used for the assignment of solution NMR data although there are a few differences. Because in solution NMR the ^15^N-^13^C transfer is achieved by INEPT instead of CP and the N-Cα~i~ and N-Cα~i-1~ scalar couplings are similar in size, the HNCA experiment in solution NMR normally includes both the Cα~i~ and Cα~i-1~ peak. In the solid-state version of the experiment, the hCANH only includes the Cα~i~ peak, which is advantageous since this reduces signal overlap. Also in solution NMR, the Cα-Cβ scalar transfer is generally evolved only half-way to create an HNCA/CB experiment were the Cβ peaks are negative.

In comparison to ^13^C-detected experiments, the assignment strategy is enormously simplified. As discussed before, in the 3-dimensional ^13^C detected experiments NCACX and NCOCX, the pivot along which a strip representing one spin system is connected to its sequential neighbor is the backbone ^15^N chemical shift. In the set of ^1^H-detected experiments, this pivot is dispersed by the chemical shift of its directly bound proton. Therefore, it is in most cases clear which peaks from the 6 experiments belong to one ^1^H-^15^N combination. As a results, before any strips have been matched, the possible amino acid types of two sequential spin systems can be deduced. In the ^13^C-detected 3D experiments at least two strips have to be matched to do the same. When considering a strip in the NCACX one can not tell just on the basis of the ^15^N chemical shift which NCOCX strip is connecting to its N-terminal neighbor. The two strips have to match based on corresponding peaks in both strips. Only after this match has been done, the possible residue types of two sequential spin systems can be deduced. Because of the reduced overlap in the ^1^H-detected strips, it is often possible for multiple strips to be matched with a relatively high degree of certainty before the stretch of connected spin systems has been matched to a specific sequence of the protein.



## Results and discussion

There is still a lot of overlap in the ^1^H-^15^N correlation relative to a similar spectrum in solution NMR (see figure {@fig:HN_solid_solution}). In the 3-dimensional spectra, it is easier to distinguish individual ^1^H-^15^N pairs. This is because most peaks do not overlap in the ^13^C dimension, thereby making it possible to see the exact peak maxima. Both H-CO and H_Cα CP conditions were 87 kHz

The solution spectrum is a modified copy of the second figure in the paper of Lukas K. Tamm and coworkers describing the solution structure of OmpG [@liang_structure_2007]. Besides the difference in linewidth between the two spectra, there are also peaks present in the solution spectrum that are absent in the solid state spectrum. These peaks correspond mostly to the flexible loops on the extra-cellular side of OmpG and some to the shorter turns on the intra-cellular side.](figures/HN_solid_solution.png){#fig:HN_solid_solution}



Using the hCANH, hcoCAcoNH, hCONH, hCOcaNH, hcaCBcaNH and hcaCBcacoNH spectra, 151 strips could be assigned corresponding to 55% of the sequence when prolines are excluded, see figure {@tbl:extend_of_assignment_table}. In addition, some of the ^13^C chemical shifts of another 16 residues, including 6 prolines (prolines do not have an amide proton and therefore do not give rise to a strip in the hCANH, hCOcaNH and hcaCBcaNH spectra), could be determined based on peaks in the hcoCAcoNH, hCONH and hcaCBcacoNH spectra. Interestingly only a few strips were left unassigned and therefore the signal set for a large part of the sequence seems to be missing. Because the ^1^H-^15^N-correlation is too crowded, the ^13^C-^15^N-projection of the hCANH, shown in figure {@fig:CAN_projection}, was used as a reference spectrum. Although some of the peaks in this projection still correspond to multiple peaks in the ^1^H-dimension, it is clear that the vast majority of peaks present are assigned.




![Assignment shown on the CN projection of the hCANH spectrum.](figures/CAN_projection.svg){#fig:CAN_projection}




In figure {@fig:strip_plots_37_52_B} a representative stretch of strips is shown. Note that towards the end of this stretch, which is also the end of the assignment for this part of the sequence, peak intensities decrease. This is especially the case for the peaks in the Cβ-correlated spectra. The decline in peak intensity towards the end of assigned stretches seems to be a trend over the whole sequence, as the lack of sufficient cross peaks is the direct cause for the assignments stopping. In figure {@fig:strip_plots_37_52_B} signal intensities of the hCANH, hcoCAcaNH, hcaCBcaNH and hcaCBcacoNH spectra are shown for the assigned residues in the sequence. As can be seen, there are very large differences in the peak intensities in the Cβ-correlated spectra, whereas the Cα correlated spectra are more consistent. The residue numbers in the plot correspond to the residue of the carbon that is measured. It can be observed that there is a strong correlation between the signal intensities of the hcaCBcaNH and the hcaCBcacoNH. This indicates that it is not the efficiency of the CP steps that is determining the signal intensity, but the ^13^C-relaxation during the delays τ that allow the scalar coupling to evolve (which are much longer than the acquisition time). As explained in the introduction, the transverse magnetization during these delays is on the Cα in the case of the hcaCBcaNH and hcaCBcacoNH (for the last experiment at least in all the delays for the Cα-Cβ transfer and half of the time during the Cα-CO transfer). In the hcoCAcoNH, the transverse magnetization during these delays is on the CO. In this light it is also interesting to note that some hCOcaNH peaks are missing towards the end of the assigned stretch in figure {@fig:strip_plots_37_52_B}. Also during this experiment, the transverse magnetization is on Cα for half of the scalar transfer step. However, the pattern here is not so clear, as the quality of this spectrum is slightly lower than expected. For example, also the hCOcaNH peak in the 46 isoleucine strip is missing while the hcaCBcaNH peak is large. We did not repeat the experiment to obtain a better spectrum, because the CO dispersion is not very high and therefore this spectrum is less valuable for assignments than the Cα and Cβ correlated experiments. For this reason, the CO-correlated spectra have been excluded from the plot in figure {@fig:peak_intensities_on_sequence}. It is likely that structural inhomogeneity and slow motions in the large extracellular loops OmpG are causing large variations in T2 relaxation times. This is discussed further in the next chapter when comparing the signal sets in the ^1^H- and ^13^C- datasets.

The peaks in the hCANH spectrum have a signal to noise around 10, which is far from excessive. Therefore it might be interesting to signal-average the hCANH experiment longer to see how many peaks are still hidden below the noise level. Also experiments with dipolar transfer schemes should be tried [@verel_adiabatic_2001][@zhou_solidstate_2012]. On well-behaved proteins such as SH3 scalar coupling based homo-nuclear transfer schemes proved slightly more efficient than dipolar based ones. However on proteins such as OmpG with T~2~' times that are about three times shorter than in SH3 (8 vs. 25 ms for Cα) DREAM transfers might lead to less signal loss.

When just focusing on the signal loss during the scalar transfer blocks, in principle only the homogeneous component of the T~2~ should play a role. Because these scalar transfer blocks are spin-echo sequences the inhomogeneous component is, at least partially, refocused by the π-pulse. What is not refocused is the coherence loss caused by motions in the μs-ms timescale. In table {@tbl:T2_times_proton_detected} linewidth and measured T~2~ relaxation times are listed. By comparing linewidths and measured T~2,hom~, the inhomogeneous contribution to T~2~ can be estimated using equation {@eq:T2_star}. As can be seen, the homogeneous component of T~2~ is still very considerable. Even higher MAS frequencies will decrease the homogeneous component of T~2~, and therefore will probably lead to better signal to noise. Progress towards higher spinning rates is still being made, and MAS of proteins close to a 100 kHz in 0.8 mm rotors has been reported [@agarwal_denovo_2014].

Table: Measured and approximated T~2~ relaxation times. Linewidth and homogeneous bulk T~2~ times were measured (bold), all other values have been calculated based on these. The measurements of the ^15^N linewidth are based on a selection of isolated peaks in the ^15^N-^1^H correlation spectra, recorded with a long enough acquisition time to avoid truncation of the signal, processed without window functions.{#tbl:T2_times_proton_detected}



Another interesting observation that can be made by looking plots in figure {@fig:peak_intensities_on_sequence} is that there is an alternating 'zig-zag' pattern between high and low signal to noise within a sequential stretch. This can be seen for the residues 44 to 49 and 112 to 117. Upon comparison to the structure calculated later, the side chains of the residues with higher signal to noise point into the pore, whereas the side chains of the residues with lower signal to noise point into the lipid bilayer. This may indicate that the lipids add disorder, increasing relaxation. It is also the case that the lipids are not deuterated here. In previous studies, the effect of deuterated versus protonated lipids on the linewidths in OmpG was compared and it was found that at 20 kHz MAS and 30% back-exchanged protons, deuteration of the lipids decreased the ^1^H-linewidth by 25%, while the effect on ^15^N-linewidth was not significant [@linser_protondetected_2011]. The effect on the ^13^C linewidth was not measured in that study.

## Conclusion

The introduction of ^1^H-detected experiments highly simplified the assignment procedure for OmpG. The addition of the ^1^H dimension adds enough dispersion to generate unique strips for most residues. The strip based approach is intuitive and because there is one strip per residue it is easier to estimate how much of the total residue sequence is represented by the spectra than in ^13^C-^13^C correlations. It became clear that the signals for a large part of the sequence are missing. Whereas there is sufficient signal intensity in the middle of the assigned stretches, the signal intensity decreases towards the extremities of these stretches. A correlation between the intensities of the peaks in the hcaCBcaNH and hcaCBcacoNH measuring the same Cβ chemical shift (but other ^1^H and ^15^N chemical shifts) indicates that most signal is lost during the evolution of the scalar coupling in the ^13^C-^13^C transfer steps and not during the CP steps.



## Materials and methods

### Sample preparation

Samples were prepared in the same way as the fully protonated samples used for the ^13^C-detected experiments described in previous chapter, with a few exceptions [@hiller_solidstate_2005]. The M9 minimal medium was perdeuterated. For the samples used to record the hCANH and hcoCAcoNH shown here the refolding buffer contained a mixture of 70:30 H~2~O:D~2~O. For the samples used in all other experiments, the refolding buffer did not contain D~2~O. Reconstitution in lipid bilayers of all samples was performed in buffer containing H~2~O. After reconstitution, the samples were pelleted and incubated in an MES buffer with pH 6.3. In the case of the hCANH and hcoCAcoNH samples, this buffer contained a mixture of 70:30 H~2~O:D~2~O. All samples were reconstituted in total lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids), except for the sample used to measure distance restraints (see chapter 6). For this sample, the polar lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids) was used. No differences where observed in ^1^H-^15^N and hCANH spectra recorded on this sample and the other samples.

### NMR experiments

Experiments were recorded on an Bruker Avance III 800 MHz ^1^H larmor frequency spectrometer at 60 kHz MAS using a triple-resonance HCN 1.3 mm probe. The temperature of the VT gas flow was set to 230 K, which roughly corresponds to a sample temperature of 300 K. 90°-pulses were 2.33 μs (107 kHz) for ^1^H, 2.75 μs (90 kHz) for ^13^C and 6.3 μs (40 kHz) for ^15^N. H-Cα and H-CO CP conditions had a contact time of 2250 μs, with the ^1^H spin lock centered at 87 kHz with a 30% ramp and the ^13^C spin lock at a constant amplitude of 29 kHz. CO-N and CA-N CP conditions had a contact time of 12 ms and a constant amplitude spin lock of 14 kHz on ^13^C and a tangent-modulated amplitude spin lock centered at 14 kHz on ^15^N.  ^15^N-^1^H CP was achieved using a contact time of 900 μs. The ^1^H spin lock was centered at 81 kHz with a 30° ramp. The spin lock on ^15^N had a constant amplitude of 39 kHz. Half echo delays τ were set to 4.7 ms for scalar transfers between Cα and CO and 7.2 ms for scalar transfers between Cα and Cβ. Selective π-pulses used during the second half of the Cα-CO in the hcaCBcacoNH and hCOcaNH experiments were Gaussian-cascade Q3 pulses [@emsley_gaussian_1990]. The pulses on CO were 350 μs with an amplitude of 1.25 kHz. The pulse on Cα was 1 ms with an amplitude of 0.14 kHz. Selective Q3 pulses during the indirect acquisition of ^13^C in the hCANH, hCONH, hCOcaNH an hcoCAcoNH had a duration of 350 μs and an amplitude of 1.01 kHz, for both CO- and Cα-selective pulses. Selective Q3 π-pulses on the entire aliphatic region during the Cα-Cβ scalar transfer blocks in the hcaCBcaNH and hcaCBcacoNH experiments were 200 μs with an amplitude of 3.37 kHz. Water suppression was achieved using the MISSISSIPI sequence without homospoil gradients [@zhou_highperformance_2008]. Swept-low-power TPPM was used for ^1^H decoupling and WALTZ-16 for ^15^N and ^13^C decoupling duing ^1^H-detection [@lewandowski_anisotropic_2010][@shaka_improved_1983]. All spectra were acquired using States-TPPI in the direct dimensions to obtain pure-phase line shapes and phase discrimination [@marion_rapid_1989]. Table {@tbl:proton_detected_aquisition_times} lists acquisition times in the indirect ^13^C and ^15^N dimensions and total duration of the experiments.
