    abstract = {Summary
Many {microRNAs} ({miRNAs)} are encoded by small gene families. In a third of all conserved Arabidopsis {miRNA} families, members vary at two or more nucleotide positions. We have focused on the related {miR159} and {miR319} families, which share sequence identity at 17 of 21 nucleotides, yet affect different developmental processes through distinct targets. {MiR159} regulates {MYB} {mRNAs}, while {miR319} predominantly acts on {TCP} {mRNAs.} In the case of {miR319}, {MYB} targeting plays at most a minor role because {miR319} expression levels and domain limit its ability to affect {MYB} {mRNAs.} In contrast, in the case of {miR159}, the {miRNA} sequence prevents effective {TCP} targeting. We complement these observations by identifying nucleotide positions relevant for {miRNA} activity with mutants recovered from a suppressor screen. Together, our findings reveal that functional specialization of {miR159} and {miR319} is achieved through both expression and sequence differences.},
