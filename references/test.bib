  abstract = {The three-dimensional structure of the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-l-Met-l-Leu-l-Phe-OH was determined by using solid-state NMR (SSNMR). The set of SSNMR data consisted of 16 13C{\textendash}15N distances and 18 torsion angle constraints (on 10 angles), recorded from uniformly 13C,15N- and 15N-labeled samples. The peptide's structure was calculated by means of simulated annealing and a newly developed protocol that ensures that all of conformational space, consistent with the structural constraints, is searched completely. The result is a high-quality structure of a molecule that has thus far not been amenable to single-crystal diffraction studies. The extensions of the SSNMR techniques and computational methods to larger systems appear promising.},

  abstract = {The Hartmann-Hahn matching profile in CP-MAS NMR shows a strong mismatch dependence if the MAS frequency is on the order of the dipolar couplings in the sample. Under these conditions, the profile breaks down into a series of narrow matching bands separated by the spinning speed, and it becomes difficult to establish and maintain an efficient matching condition. Variable-amplitude CP (VACP), as introduced previously (Peersen et al., J. Magn. Reson. A104, 334, 1993), has been proven to be effective for restoring flat profiles at high spinning speeds. Here, a refined implementation of VACP using a ramped-amplitude cross-polarization sequence (RAMP-CP) is described. The order of the amplitude modulation is shown to be of importance for the cross-polarization process. The new pulse sequence with a linear amplitude ramp is not only easier to set up but also improves the performance of the variable-amplitude experiment in that it produces flat profiles over a wider range of matching conditions even with short total contact times. An increase in signal intensity is obtained compared to both con ventional CP and the originally proposed VACP sequence.},

After purification under denaturing conditions, the protein was refolded in the detergent Genapol X-080, where it gained a structure rich in beta sheet as evidenced by a CD spectrum similar to that of the native form. Electrophoretic analysis and limited proteolysis experiments suggested that refolded OmpGm exists in at least three forms. Nevertheless, the recombinant protein formed uniform channels in planar bilayers with a conductance of 0.81 nS (1 M NaCl, pH 7.5). Previous biochemical studies had suggested that OmpG is a monomeric porin, rather than the usual trimer. Bilayer recordings substantiated this proposal; voltage-induced closures occurred consistently in a single step, and channel block by Gd(3+) lacked the cooperativity seen with the trimeric porin OmpF. The availability of milligram amounts of a monomeric porin will be useful both for basic studies of porin function and for membrane protein engineering.},

  abstract = {We present a systematic study of proton linewidths in rigid solids as a function of sample spinning frequency and proton density, with the latter controlled by the ratio of protonated and perdeuterated model compounds. We find that the linewidth correlates more closely with the overall proton density (\ensuremath{\rho}H) than the size of local clusters of 1H spins. At relatively high magic-angle spinning (MAS) rates, the linewidth depends linearly upon the inverse MAS rate. In the limit of infinite spinning rate and/or zero proton concentration, the linewidth extrapolates to a non-zero value, owing to contributions from scalar couplings, chemical shift dispersion, and B0 field inhomogeneity. The slope of this line depends on the overall concentration of unexchangeable protons in the sample and the spinning rate. At up to 30\% protonation levels (\ensuremath{\sim}2 1H/100 {\AA}3), proton detection experiments are demonstrated to have a substantial (2- to 3-fold) sensitivity gain over corresponding 13C-detected experiments. Within this range, the absolute sensitivity increases with protonation level; the optimal compromise between sensitivity and resolution is in the range of 20{\textendash}30\% protonation. We illustrate the use of dilute protons for polarization transfer to and from low-\ensuremath{\gamma} spins within 5 {\AA}, and to be utilized as both magnetization source and detection spins. The intermediate protonation regime enhances relaxation properties, which we expect will enable new types of 1H correlation pulse sequences to be implemented with improved resolution and sensitivity.},

  abstract = {The M2 protein of influenza A virus is a membrane-spanning tetrameric proton channel targeted by the antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine. Resistance to these drugs has compromised their effectiveness against many influenza strains, including pandemic H1N1. A recent crystal structure of M2(22{\textendash}46) showed electron densities attributed to a single amantadine in the amino-terminal half of the pore, indicating a physical occlusion mechanism for inhibition. However, a solution NMR structure of M2(18{\textendash}60) showed four rimantadines bound to the carboxy-terminal lipid-facing surface of the helices, suggesting an allosteric mechanism. Here we show by solid-state NMR spectroscopy that two amantadine-binding sites exist in M2 in phospholipid bilayers. The high-affinity site, occupied by a single amantadine, is located in the N-terminal channel lumen, surrounded by residues mutated in amantadine-resistant viruses. Quantification of the protein{\textendash}amantadine distances resulted in a 0.3 {\AA}-resolution structure of the high-affinity binding site. The second, low-affinity, site was observed on the C-terminal protein surface, but only when the drug reaches high concentrations in the bilayer. The orientation and dynamics of the drug are distinct in the two sites, as shown by 2H NMR. These results indicate that amantadine physically occludes the M2 channel, thus paving the way for developing new antiviral drugs against influenza viruses. The study demonstrates the ability of solid-state NMR to elucidate small-molecule interactions with membrane proteins and determine high-resolution structures of their complexes.},

  abstract = {A technique is presented to recouple homonuclear dipolar couplings between dilute spin pairs such as 13 C{\textendash} 13 C systems under very fast magic angle spinning (MAS) in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR)spectroscopy. The presented technique, finite pulse rf driven recoupling (fpRFDR), restores homonuclear dipolar interactions based on constructive usage of finite pulse-width effects in a phase- and symmetry-cycled \ensuremath{\pi}-pulse train in which a rotor-synchronous \ensuremath{\pi} pulse is applied every rotation period. The restored effective dipolar interaction has the form of a zero-quantum dipolar Hamiltonian for static solids, whose symmetry in spin space is different from that obtained by conventional rf driven recoupling (RFDR) techniques. It is demonstrated that the efficiency of recoupling by fpRFDR is not strongly dependent on chemical shift differences or resonance offsets in contrast to previous recoupling methods under very fast MAS. To realize distance measurements without effects of spin relaxation, a constant-time version of fpRFDR (CT-fpRFDR) is introduced, in which the effective evolution period is varied by refocusing dipolar evolution with a rotor-synchronized solid echo while the total recoupling period is kept constant. From CT-fpRFDR experiments at a spinning speed of 30.3 kHz in a field of 17.6 T, the 13 C{\textendash} 13 C distance of {[}1- 13 C {]} Ala {\textendash}{[}1- 13 C {]} Gly{\textendash}Gly was determined to be 3.27 {\AA}, which agrees well with the value of 3.20 {\AA} obtained by x-ray diffraction. Also, two-dimensional (2D) 13 C/ 13 C chemical-shift correlation NMR spectrum in a field of 9.4 T was obtained with fpRFDR for fibrils of the segmentally 13 C - and 15 N -labeled Alzheimer's \ensuremath{\beta}-Amyloid fragments, A\ensuremath{\beta} 16{\textendash}22 (residues 16{\textendash}22 taken from the 40-residue A\ensuremath{\beta} peptide) in which Leu-17 through Ala-21 are uniformly 13 C - and 15 N -labeled. Most 13 C resonances for the main chain as well as for the side chains are assigned based on 2D 13 C/ 13 C chemical-shift correlation patterns specific to amino-acid types. Examination of the obtained 13 C chemical shifts revealed the formation of \ensuremath{\beta}-strand across the entire molecule of A\ensuremath{\beta} 16{\textendash}22 . Possibility of high throughput determination of global main-chain structures based on 13 C shifts obtained from 2D 13 C/ 13 C chemical-shift correlation under very fast MAS is also discussed for uniformly/segmentally 13 C -labeled protein/peptide samples.},

A new experimental approach involving multispin 13C labeling and 2-D NMR is presented. Bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers of Rhodobacter sphaeroides R26 were reconstituted with uniformly 13C biosynthetically labeled (plant) Pheo a in the two pheophytin binding sites. From the multispin labeled samples 1-D and 2-D solid-state 13C magic angle spinning NMR spectra could be obtained and used to characterize the pheophytin a ground state in the Rb. sphaeroides R26 RCs, i.e., without a necessity for time-consuming selective labeling strategies involving organic synthesis. From the 2-D solid state 13C?13C correlation spectra collected with spinning speeds of 8 and 10 kHz, with mixing times of 1 and 0.8 ms, many 13C resonances of the {[}U-13C{]}Pheo a molecules reconstituted in the RCs could be assigned in a single set of experiments. Parts of the pheophytins interacting with the protein, at the level of 13C shifts modified by binding, could be identified. Small reconstitution shifts are detected for the 172 side chain of ring IV. In contrast, there is no evidence for electrostatic differences between the two Pheo a, for instance, due to a possibly strong selective electrostatic interaction with Glu L104 on the active branch. The protonation states appear the same, and the NMR suggests a strong overall similarity between the ground states of the two Pheo a, which is of interest in view of the asymmetry of the electron transfer.},

  abstract = {We describe an approach to efficiently determine the backbone conformation of solid proteins that utilizes selective and extensive 13C labeling in conjunction with two-dimensional magic-angle-spinning NMR. The selective 13C labeling approach aims to reduce line broadening and other multispin complications encountered in solid-state NMR of uniformly labeled proteins while still enhancing the sensitivity of NMR spectra. It is achieved by using specifically labeled glucose or glycerol as the sole carbon source in the protein expression medium. For amino acids synthesized in the linear part of the biosynthetic pathways, {[}1-13C{]}glucose preferentially labels the ends of the side chains, while {[}2-13C{]}glycerol labels the C\ensuremath{\alpha} of these residues. Amino acids produced from the citric-acid cycle are labeled in a more complex manner. Information on the secondary structure of such a labeled protein was obtained by measuring multiple backbone torsion angles \ensuremath{\varphi} simultaneously, using an isotropic{\textendash}anisotropic 2D correlation technique, the HNCH experiment. Initial experiments for resonance assignment of a selectively 13C labeled protein were performed using 15N{\textendash}13C 2D correlation spectroscopy. From the time dependence of the 15N{\textendash}13C dipolar coherence transfer, both intraresidue and interresidue connectivities can be observed, thus yielding partial sequential assignment. We demonstrate the selective 13C labeling and these 2D NMR experiments on a 8.5-kDa model protein, ubiquitin. This isotope-edited NMR approach is expected to facilitate the structure determination of proteins in the solid state.},

  abstract = {Remarkable progress in solid-state NMR has enabled complete structure determination of uniformly labeled proteins in the size range of 510 kDa. Expanding these applications to larger or mass-limited systems requires further improvements in spectral sensitivity, for which inverse detection of 13C and 15N signals with 1H is one promising approach. Proton detection has previously been demonstrated to offer sensitivity benefits in the limit of sparse protonation or with 30 kHz magic-angle spinning (MAS). Here we focus on experimental schemes for proteins with 100\% protonation. Full protonation simplifies sample preparation and permits more complete chemical shift information to be obtained from a single sample. We demonstrate experimental schemes using the fully protonated, uniformly 13C,15N-labeled protein GB1 at 40 kHz MAS rate with 1.6-mm rotors. At 500 MHz proton frequency, 1-ppm proton line widths were observed (500 150 Hz), and the sensitivity was enhanced by 3 and 4 times, respectively, versus direct 13C and 15N detection. The enhanced sensitivity enabled a family of 3D experiments for spectral assignment to be performed in a time-efficient manner with less than a micromole of protein. CANH, CONH, and NCAH 3D spectra provided sufficient resolution and sensitivity to make full backbone and partial side-chain proton assignments. At 750 MHz proton frequency and 40 kHz MAS rate, proton line widths improve further in an absolute sense (360 115 Hz). Sensitivity and resolution increase in a better than linear manner with increasing magnetic field, resulting in 14 times greater sensitivity for 1H detection relative to that of 15N detection.},

  abstract = {Protein methyl groups have recently been the subject of much attention in NMR spectroscopy because of the opportunities that they provide to obtain information about the structure and dynamics of proteins and protein complexes. With the advent of selective labeling schemes, methyl groups are particularly interesting in the context of chemical shift based protein structure determination, an approach that to date has exploited primarily the mapping between protein structures and backbone chemical shifts. In order to extend the scope of chemical shifts for structure determination, we present here the CH3Shift method of performing structure-based predictions of methyl chemical shifts. The terms considered in the predictions take account of ring current, magnetic anisotropy, electric field, rotameric type, and dihedral angle effects, which are considered in conjunction with polynomial functions of interatomic distances. We show that the CH3Shift method achieves an accuracy in the predictions that ranges from 0.133 to 0.198 ppm for 1H chemical shifts for Ala, Thr, Val, Leu and Ile methyl groups. We illustrate the use of the method by assessing the accuracy of side-chain structures in structural ensembles representing the dynamics of proteins.},

Soc. 133 (2011) 3943{\textendash}3953{]}. In these RDSD experiments, since the broadened second-order rotational resonance conditions are dominated by the radio frequency field strength and the phase shifts, as well as the size of reintroduced dipolar couplings, the different R 2 n v sequences display unique polarization transfer behaviors and different recoupling frequency bandwidths. Herein, we present a series of modified R 2 n v sequences, dubbed COmbined R 2 n v -Driven (CORD), that yield broadband homonuclear dipolar recoupling and give rise to uniform distribution of cross peak intensities across the entire correlation spectrum. We report NMR experiments and numerical simulations demonstrating that these CORD spin diffusion sequences are suitable for broadband recoupling at a wide range of magnetic fields and MAS frequencies, including fast-MAS conditions (\ensuremath{\nu}r = 40 kHz and above). Since these CORD sequences are largely insensitive to dipolar truncation, they are well suited for the determination of long-range distance constraints, which are indispensable for the structural characterization of a broad range of systems. Using U-13C,15N-alanine and U{\textendash}13C,15N-histidine, we show that under fast-MAS conditions, the CORD sequences display polarization transfer efficiencies within broadband frequency regions that are generally higher than those offered by other existing spin diffusion pulse schemes. A 89-residue U{\textendash}13C,15N-dynein light chain (LC8) protein has also been used to demonstrate that the CORD sequences exhibit uniformly high cross peak intensities across the entire chemical shift range.},

  abstract = {The advantages offered by ultra-fast (\&gt;60 kHz) magic angle spinning (MAS) rotation for the study of biological samples, notably containing paramagnetic centers are explored.

It is shown that optimal conditions for performing solid-state 13C NMR under 60 kHz MAS are obtained with low-power CW 1H decoupling, as well as after a low-power 1H,13C cross-polarization step at a double-quantum matching condition. Acquisition with low-power decoupling highlights the existence of rotational decoupling sidebands. The sideband intensities and the existence of first and second rotary conditions are explained in the framework of the Floquet{\textendash}van Vleck theory.

As a result, optimal 13C spectra of the oxidized, paramagnetic form of human copper zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD) can be obtained employing rf-fields which do not exceed 40 kHz during the whole experiment. This enables the removal of unwanted heating which can lead to deterioration of the sample. Furthermore, combined with the short 1H T1s, this allows the repetition rate of the experiments to be shortened from 3 s to 500 ms, thus compensating for the sensitivity loss due to the smaller sample volume in a 1.3 mm rotor. The result is that 2D 13C{\textendash}13C correlation could be acquired in about 24 h on less than 1 mg of SOD sample.},

However, its potential has been limited by the difficulty of interpreting NMR spectra in the presence of broadened and overlapping resonance lines and low signal-to-noise ratios. Here we present stereo-array isotope labelling (SAIL), a technique that can overcome many of these problems by applying a complete stereospecific and regiospecific pattern of stable isotopes that is optimal with regard to the quality and information content of the resulting NMR spectra. SAIL uses exclusively chemically and enzymatically synthesized amino acids for cell-free protein expression. We demonstrate for the 17-kDa protein calmodulin and the 41-kDa maltodextrin-binding protein that SAIL offers sharpened lines, spectral simplification without loss of information, and the ability to rapidly collect the structural restraints required to solve a high-quality solution structure for proteins twice as large as commonly solved by NMR. It thus makes a large class of proteins newly accessible to detailed solution structure determination.},

Analysis of NMR secondary chemical shifts plays an important role in such studies, but the output of such analyses depends on the accuracy of reference random coil chemical shifts. Although uniform perdeuteration of IDPs can dramatically increase spectral resolution, a feature particularly important for the poorly dispersed IDP spectra, the impact of deuterium isotope shifts on random coil values has not yet been fully characterized. Very precise 2H isotope shift measurements for 13C\ensuremath{\alpha}, 13C\ensuremath{\beta}, 13C', 15N, and 1HN have been obtained by using a mixed sample of protonated and uniformly perdeuterated -synuclein, a protein with chemical shifts exceptionally close to random coil values. Decomposition of these isotope shifts into one-bond, two-bond and three-bond effects as well as intra- and sequential residue contributions shows that such an analysis, which ignores conformational dependence, is meaningful but does not fully describe the total isotope shift to within the precision of the measurements. Random coil 2H isotope shifts provide an important starting point for analysis of such shifts in structural terms in folded proteins, where they are known to depend strongly on local geometry.},

  abstract = {Perdeuteration of all non-exchangeable proton sites can significantly increase the size of proteins and protein complexes for which NMR resonance assignments and structural studies are possible. Backbone1H,15N,13CO,13C\ensuremath{\alpha}and13C\ensuremath{\beta}chemical shifts and aliphatic side-chain13C and1HN/15N chemical shifts for human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II), a 259 residue 29 kDa metalloenzyme, have been determined using a strategy based on 2D, 3D and 4D heteronuclear NMR experiments, and on perdeuterated13C/15N-labeled protein. To date, HCA II is one of the largest monomeric proteins studied in detail by high-resolution NMR. Of the backbone resonances, 85\% have been assigned using fully protonated15N and3C/15N-labeled protein in conjunction with established procedures based on now standard 2D and 3D NMR experiments. HCA II has been perdeuterated both to complete the backbone resonance assignment and to assign the aliphatic side-chain13C and1HN/15N resonances. The incorporation of2H into HCA II dramatically decreases the rate of13C and1HNT2relaxation. This, in turn, increases the sensitivity of several key1H/13C/15N triple-resonance correlation experiments. Many otherwise marginal heteronuclear 3D and 4D correlation experiments, which are important to the assignment strategy detailed herein, can now be executed successfully on HCA II. Further analysis suggests that, from the perspective of sensitivity, perdeuteration should allow other proteins with rotational correlation times significantly longer than HCA II (\ensuremath{\tau}c=11.4 ns) to be studied successfully with these experiments. Two different protocols have been used to characterize the secondary structure of HCA II from backbone chemical-shift data. Secondary structural elements determined in this manner compare favorably with those elements determined from a consensus analysis of the HCA II crystal structure. Finally, having outlined a general strategy for assigning backbone and side-chain resonances in a perdeuterated large protein, we propose a strategy whereby this information can be used to glean more detailed structural information from the partially or fully protonated protein equivalent.},

The Freeman{\textendash}Wimley algorithm, which is a highly accurate prediction method based on the physicochemical properties of experimentally characterized transmembrane \ensuremath{\beta} barrel (TMBB) structures, was used to predict TMBBs in the genome of Salmonella typhimurium LT2. The previously uncharacterized product of gene yshA was tested as a model for validating the algorithm. YshA is a highly conserved 230-residue protein that is predicted to have 10 transmembrane \ensuremath{\beta}-strands and an N-terminal signal sequence. All of the physicochemical and spectroscopic properties exhibited by YshA are consistent with the prediction that it is a TMBB. Specifically, recombinant YshA localizes to the outer membrane when expressed in Escherichia coli; YshA has a \ensuremath{\beta}-sheet-rich secondary structure with stable tertiary contacts in the presence of detergent micelles or when reconstituted into a lipid bilayer. When in a lipid bilayer, YshA forms a membrane-spanning pore with an effective radius of {\textasciitilde} 0.7 nm. Taken together, these data substantiate the predictions made by the Freeman{\textendash}Wimley algorithm by showing that YshA is a TMBB protein.},

  abstract = {The two principal components of biological membranes, the lipid bilayer and the proteins integrated within it, have coevolved for specific functions that mediate the interactions of cells with their environment. Molecular structures can provide very significant insights about protein function. In the case of membrane proteins, the physical and chemical properties of lipids and proteins are highly interdependent; therefore structure determination should include the membrane environment. Considering the membrane alongside the protein eliminates the possibility that crystal contacts or detergent molecules could distort protein structure, dynamics, and function and enables ligand binding studies to be performed in a natural setting.Solid-state NMR spectroscopy is compatible with three-dimensional structure determination of membrane proteins in phospholipid bilayer membranes under physiological conditions and has played an important role in elucidating the physical and chemical properties of biological membranes, providing key information about the structure and dynamics of the phospholipid components. Recently, developments in the recombinant expression of membrane proteins, sample preparation, pulse sequences for high-resolution spectroscopy, radio frequency probes, high-field magnets, and computational methods have enabled a number of membrane protein structures to be determined in lipid bilayer membranes.In this Account, we illustrate solid-state NMR methods with examples from two bacterial outer membrane proteins (OmpX and Ail) that form integral membrane ?-barrels. The ability to measure orientation-dependent frequencies in the solid-state NMR spectra of membrane-embedded proteins provides the foundation for a powerful approach to structure determination based primarily on orientation restraints. Orientation restraints are particularly useful for NMR structural studies of membrane proteins because they provide information about both three-dimensional structure and the orientation of the protein within the membrane. When combined with dihedral angle restraints derived from analysis of isotropic chemical shifts, molecular fragment replacement, and de novo structure prediction, orientation restraints can yield high-quality three-dimensional structures with few or no distance restraints. Using complementary solid-state NMR methods based on oriented sample (OS) and magic angle spinning (MAS) approaches, one can resolve and assign multiple peaks through the use of 15N/13C labeled samples and measure precise restraints to determine structures.},

  abstract = {An equation for calculating the distances between the atoms involved in forming an idealized hydrogen bond in a parallel or antiparallel \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel has been derived by adjusting the corresponding data given by Pauling and Corey for a \ensuremath{\beta}-sheet. Based on these distances, a geometrical optimization method was developed, by which one can generate various idealized \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels: parallel or antiparallel, tilted or non-tilted, right-tilted or left-tilted. For each type of idealized \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel thus obtained, the corresponding conformation and characteristic geometric parameters as well as their relationship are analyzed and discussed. Since the strand in a tilted \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel traces a curve rather than a straight line on a cylinderlike surface, a regular chain in which the dihedral angles of each residue are the same cannot form a tilted \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel but only a non-tilted \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel. As observed, the strands of a right-tilted \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel possess a very strong right-handed twist. The radii of the idealized tilted parallel and antiparallel \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels are greater than those of the corresponding non-tilted ones by \ensuremath{\sim} 1 {\AA} and \ensuremath{\sim} 1\ensuremath{\cdot}5 {\AA}, respectively. Consequently, there is relatively more room for a tilted \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel to accommodate the internal side-chains, suggesting that a conformational change from a non-tilted \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel to a tilted one would ease the repulsion among the crowded internal side-chains so as to make the structure more stable. The values of root-mean-square fits indicate that the idealized right-tilted \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels coincide quite well with the observed \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels in both parallel and antiparallel cases.},

  abstract = {A new computational approach has been developed to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins in membranes by minimizing their transfer energies from water to the lipid bilayer. The membrane hydrocarbon core was approximated as a planar slab of adjustable thickness with decadiene-like interior and interfacial polarity profiles derived from published EPR studies. Applicability and accuracy of the method was verified for a set of 24 transmembrane proteins whose orientations in membranes have been studied by spin-labeling, chemical modification, fluorescence, ATR FTIR, NMR, cryo-microscopy, and neutron diffraction. Subsequently, the optimal rotational and translational positions were calculated for 109 transmembrane, five integral monotopic and 27 peripheral protein complexes with known 3D structures. This method can reliably distinguish transmembrane and integral monotopic proteins from water-soluble proteins based on their transfer energies and membrane penetration depths. The accuracies of calculated hydrophobic thicknesses and tilt angles were \ensuremath{\sim}1 {\AA} and 2{\textdegree}, respectively, judging from their deviations in different crystal forms of the same proteins. The hydrophobic thicknesses of transmembrane proteins ranged from 21.1 to 43.8 {\AA} depending on the type of biological membrane, while their tilt angles with respect to the bilayer normal varied from zero in symmetric complexes to 26{\textdegree} in asymmetric structures. Calculated hydrophobic boundaries of proteins are located \ensuremath{\sim}5 {\AA} lower than lipid phosphates and correspond to the zero membrane depth parameter of spin-labeled residues. Coordinates of all studied proteins with their membrane boundaries can be found in the Orientations of Proteins in Membranes (OPM) database:http://opm.phar.umich.edu/.},

Many structural methods are reviewed including modern liquid crystallography of lipid bilayers that deals with the fully developed undulation fluctuations that occur in the L\ensuremath{\alpha} phase. These fluctuations degrade the higher order diffraction data in a way that, if unrecognized, leads to erroneous conclusions regarding bilayer structure. Diffraction measurements at high instrumental resolution provide a measure of these fluctuations. In addition to providing better structural determination, this opens a new window on interactions between bilayers, so the experimental determination of interbilayer interaction parameters is reviewed briefly. We introduce a new structural correction based on fluctuations that has not been included in any previous studies. Updated measurements, such as for the area compressibility modulus, are used to provide adjustments to many of the literature values of structural quantities. Since the gel (L\ensuremath{{\beta}{'}}) phase is valuable as a stepping stone for obtaining fluid phase results, a brief review is given of the lower temperature phases. The uncertainty in structural results for lipid bilayers is being reduced and best current values are provided for bilayers of five lipids.},

  abstract = {CXCR1 is one of two high-affinity receptors for the CXC chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8), a major mediator of immune and inflammatory responses implicated in many disorders, including tumour growth. IL-8, released in response to inflammatory stimuli, binds to the extracellular side of CXCR1. The ligand-activated intracellular signalling pathways result in neutrophil migration to the site of inflammation. CXCR1 is a class A, rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the largest class of integral membrane proteins responsible for cellular signal transduction and targeted as drug receptors. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism of CXCR1 signal transduction is poorly understood owing to the limited structural information available. Recent structural determination of GPCRs has advanced by modifying the receptors with stabilizing mutations, insertion of the protein T4 lysozyme and truncations of their amino acid sequences, as well as addition of stabilizing antibodies and small molecules that facilitate crystallization in cubic phase monoolein mixtures. The intracellular loops of GPCRs are crucial for G-protein interactions, and activation of CXCR1 involves both amino-terminal residues and extracellular loops. Our previous nuclear magnetic resonance studies indicate that IL-8 binding to the N-terminal residues is mediated by the membrane, underscoring the importance of the phospholipid bilayer for physiological activity. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of human CXCR1 determined by NMR spectroscopy. The receptor is in liquid crystalline phospholipid bilayers, without modification of its amino acid sequence and under physiological conditions. Features important for intracellular G-protein activation and signal transduction are revealed. The structure of human CXCR1 in a lipid bilayer should help to facilitate the discovery of new compounds that interact with GPCRs and combat diseases such as breast cancer.},

  abstract = {We present a systematic study of the effect of the level of exchangeable protons on the observed amide proton linewidth obtained in perdeuterated proteins. Decreasing the amount of D2O employed in the crystallization buffer from 90 to 0\%, we observe a fourfold increase in linewidth for both 1H and 15N resonances. At the same time, we find a gradual increase in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for 1H{\textendash}15N correlations in dipolar coupling based experiments for H2O concentrations of up to 40\%. Beyond 40\%, a significant reduction in SNR is observed. Scalar-coupling based 1H{\textendash}15N correlation experiments yield a nearly constant SNR for samples prepared with \ensuremath{\leq}30\% H2O. Samples in which more H2O is employed for crystallization show a significantly reduced NMR intensity. Calculation of the SNR by taking into account the reduction in 1H T 1 in samples containing more protons (SNR per unit time), yields a maximum SNR for samples crystallized using 30 and 40\% H2O for scalar and dipolar coupling based experiments, respectively. A sensitivity gain of 3.8 is obtained by increasing the H2O concentration from 10 to 40\% in the CP based experiment, whereas the linewidth only becomes 1.5 times broader. In general, we find that CP is more favorable compared to INEPT based transfer when the number of possible 1H,1H interactions increases. At low levels of deuteration (\ensuremath{\geq}60\% H2O in the crystallization buffer), resonances from rigid residues are broadened beyond detection. All experiments are carried out at MAS frequency of 24 kHz employing perdeuterated samples of the chicken \ensuremath{\alpha}-spectrin SH3 domain.},

  abstract = {Of great interest to the academic and pharmaceutical research communities, helical transmembrane proteins are characterized by their ability to dissolve and fold in lipid bilayers{\textemdash}properties conferred by polypeptide spans termed transmembrane domains (TMDs). The apolar nature of TMDs necessitates the use of membrane-mimetic solvents for many structure and folding studies. This review examines the relationship between TMD structure and solvent environment, focusing on principles elucidated largely in membrane-mimetic environments with single-TMD protein and peptide models. Following a brief description of TMD sequence and conformational characteristics gleaned from the structural database, we present an overview of the conceptual models used to study folding in vitro. The impact of sequence and solvent context on the incorporation of TMDs into membranes, and its role in measurements of TMD self-assembly strengths, is then described. We conclude with a discussion of the nonspecific effects of membrane components on TMD stability.},

  abstract = {We used high-resolution proton-detected multidimensional NMR to study the solvent-exposed parts of a seven-helical integral membrane proton pump, proteorhodopsin (PR). PR samples were prepared by growing the apoprotein on fully deuterated medium and reintroducing protons to solvent-accessible sites through exchange with protonated buffer. This preparation leads to NMR spectra with proton resolution down to ca. 0.2 ppm at fast spinning (28 kHz) in a protein back-exchanged at a level of 40\%. Novel three-dimensional proton-detected chemical shift correlation spectroscopy allowed for the identification and resonance assignment of the solvent-exposed parts of the protein. Most of the observed residues are located at the membrane interface, but there are notable exceptions, particularly in helix G, where most of the residues are susceptible to H/D exchange. This helix contains Schiff base-forming Lys231, and many conserved polar residues in the extracellular half, such as Asn220, Tyr223, Asn224, Asp227, and Asn230. We proposed earlier that high mobility of the F-G loop may transiently expose a hydrophilic cavity in the extracellular half of the protein, similar to the one found in xanthorhodopsin. Solvent accessibility of helix G is in line with this hypothesis, implying that such a cavity may be a part of the proton-conducting pathway lined by this helix.},

  abstract = {Accurate distance measurements between pairs of nuclear spins can provide detailed information about molecular structure in the solid state. The rotational resonance (R2) technique, in particular, has been used to measure internuclear distances in a variety of compounds, often between pairs of 13C nuclei where the outer range is 5?6 {\AA}. Recent studies have revealed that the spin dynamics at rotational resonance are influenced by zero-quantum line shape parameters including T2zq and the dispersion in isotropic chemical shift differences. Errors in the estimation of these parameters are often the limiting factor in determining the accuracy of a distance measurement. Here we present a modification of R2, termed ?rotational resonance tickling? (R2T), which uses a ramped rf field to induce fast passage through the dipolar resonance condition, thereby greatly reducing the dependence of the spin dynamics on zero-quantum parameters. Extraction of distance information from the resulting exchange curves is approximately a single-parameter fit, with accuracies in model systems that appear to be on the order of \ensuremath{\pm}0.1 {\AA} or better. An additional feature of the technique is that it does not demand the very high-power 1H decoupling fields typically required in other recoupling experiments to limit signal loss during mixing. We demonstrate the technique in a pair of 13C2-labeled model compounds, tyrosine ethyl ester and glycylglycine hydrochloride, with effective internuclear distances (including intermolecular effects) of 5.05 and 4.3 {\AA}, respectively.},

Results obtained by trypsin treatment of intact cells and cell envelopes of F. nucleatum, and from limited proteolysis of purified FomA protein, indicated that the N-terminal part of the FomA protein is not an integral part of the \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel, but forms a periplasmic domain. Based on these results a new topology model is proposed for the FomA protein, where the C-terminal part forms a 14-stranded \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel separate from the periplasmic N-terminal domain.},

Here we compare the results of applying several computerised structure prediction algorithms to the sequence of OmpG. Furthermore, we probe the OmpG topology by both an established chemical labelling approach and a new method which combines epitope insertion and surface plasmon resonance. The computational approaches are broadly accurate but the exact choice of the number of \ensuremath{\beta} strands remains difficult. The algorithms also tend to predict the entire \ensuremath{\beta} strand rather than just the transmembrane region. Epitope insertion clearly pinpoints exposed loops but its utility in defining buried or periplasmic sites is less clear cut. Cysteine-mutant labelling is largely confined to exposed residues but one periplasmic cysteine may be labelled by reagents entering via the OmpG pore.},

As input, the algorithm uses only the protein sequence and lists of 15N/13C\ensuremath{\alpha} crosspeaks from 2D NCACX and NCOCX spectra that include possible residue-type assignments of each crosspeak. Assignment of crosspeaks to specific residues is carried out by a Monte Carlo/simulated annealing algorithm, implemented in the program MC\_ASSIGN1. The algorithm tolerates substantial ambiguity in residue-type assignments and coexistence of visible and invisible segments in the protein sequence. We use MC\_ASSIGN1 and our own 2D spectra to replicate and extend the sequential assignments for uniformly labeled HET-s(218-289) fibrils previously determined manually by Siemer et al. (J. Biomolec. NMR, vol. 34, pp. 75-87, 2006) from a more extensive set of 2D and 3D spectra. Accurate assignments by MC\_ASSIGN1 do not require data that are of exceptionally high quality. Use of MC\_ASSIGN1 (and its extensions to other types of 2D and 3D data) is likely to alleviate many of the difficulties and uncertainties associated with manual resonance assignments in solid state NMR studies of uniformly labeled proteins, where spectral resolution and signal-to-noise are often sub-optimal.},

The program is designed to emulate a NMR spectrometer by letting the user specify high-level NMR concepts such as spin systems, nuclear spin interactions, RF irradiation, free precession, phase cycling, coherence-order filtering, and implicit/explicit acquisition. These elements are implemented using the Tcl scripting language to ensure a minimum of programming overhead and direct interpretation without the need for compilation, while maintaining the flexibility of a full-featured programming language. Basicly, there are no intrinsic limitations to the number of spins, types of interactions, sample conditions (static or spinning, powders, uniaxially oriented molecules, single crystals, or solutions), and the complexity or number of spectral dimensions for the pulse sequence. The applicability ranges from simple 1D experiments to advanced multiple-pulse and multiple-dimensional experiments, series of simulations, parameter scans, complex data manipulation/visualization, and iterative fitting of simulated to experimental spectra. A major effort has been devoted to optimizing the computation speed using state-of-the-art algorithms for the time-consuming parts of the calculations implemented in the core of the program using the C programming language. Modification and maintenance of the program are facilitated by releasing the program as open source software (General Public License) currently at http://nmr.imsb.au.dk. The general features of the program are demonstrated by numerical simulations of various aspects for REDOR, rotational resonance, DRAMA, DRAWS, HORROR, C7, TEDOR, POST-C7, CW decoupling, TPPM, F-SLG, SLF, SEMA-CP, PISEMA, RFDR, QCPMG-MAS, and MQ-MAS experiments.},

  abstract = {A simple spectroscopic filtering technique is presented that may aid the assignment of 13C and 15N resonances of methyl-containing amino-acids in solid-state magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR. A filtering block that selects methyl resonances is introduced in two-dimensional (2D) 13C-homonuclear and 15N{\textendash}13C heteronuclear correlation experiments. The 2D 13C{\textendash}13C correlation spectra are recorded with the methyl filter implemented prior to a 13C{\textendash}13C mixing step. It is shown that these methyl-filtered 13C-homonuclear correlation spectra are instrumental in the assignment of C\ensuremath{\delta} resonances of leucines by suppression of C\ensuremath{\gamma}{\textendash}C\ensuremath{\delta} cross peaks. Further, a methyl filter is implemented prior to a 15N{\textendash}13C transferred-echo double resonance (TEDOR) exchange scheme to obtain 2D 15N{\textendash}13C heteronuclear correlation spectra. These experiments provide correlations between methyl groups and backbone amides. Some of the observed sequential 15N{\textendash}13C correlations form the basis for initial sequence-specific assignments of backbone signals of the outer-membrane protein G.},

This leads to a reversal of the averaging processes compared to normal high-power continuous-wave decoupling. Such an approach becomes increasingly interesting with increasing MAS spinning frequency. In rigid solids, low-power decoupling becomes competitive above about 40 kHz MAS frequency.},

  abstract = {\ensuremath{\beta}-barrel membrane proteins perform important functions in the outer membranes (OMs) of Gram-negative bacteria and of the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotes. The protein complexes that assemble these proteins in their respective membranes have been identified and shown to contain a component that has been conserved from bacteria to humans. \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel proteins are handled differently from \ensuremath{\alpha}-helical membrane proteins in the cell in order to efficiently transport them to their final locations in unfolded but folding-competent states. The mechanism by which the assembly complex then binds, folds, and inserts \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels into the membrane is not well understood, but recent structural, biochemical, and genetic studies have begun to elucidate elements of how the complex provides a facilitated pathway for \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel assembly. Ultimately, studies of the mechanism of \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel assembly and comparison to the better-understood process of \ensuremath{\alpha}-helical membrane protein assembly will reveal whether there are general principles that guide the folding and insertion of all membrane proteins.},

  abstract = {The x-ray coordinates of \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel transmembrane proteins from the porins superfamily and relatives are used to calculate the mean tilt of the \ensuremath{\beta}-strands and their mean local twist and coiling angles. The 13 proteins examined correspond to \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels with 8 to 22 strands, and shear numbers ranging from 8 to 24. The results are compared with predictions from the model of Murzin, Lesk, and Chothia for symmetrical regular barrels. Good agreement is found for the mean strand tilt, but the twist angles are smaller than those for open \ensuremath{\beta}-sheets and \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels with shorter strands. The model is reparameterised to account for the reduced twist characteristic of long-stranded transmembrane \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels. This produces predictions of both twist and coiling angles that are in agreement with the mean values obtained from the x-ray structures. With the optimized parameters, the model can then be used to determine twist and coiling angles of transmembrane \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels from measurements of the amide band infrared dichroism in oriented membranes. Satisfactory agreement is obtained for OmpF. The strand tilt obtained from the x-ray coordinates, or from the reparameterised model, can be combined with infrared dichroism measurements to obtain information on the orientation of the \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel assembly in the membrane.},

  abstract = {Biological magic angle spinning (MAS) solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has developed rapidly over the past two decades. For the structure determination of a protein by solid-state NMR, routinely 13C,13C distance restraints as well as dihedral restraints are employed. In protonated samples, this is achieved by growing the bacterium on a medium which contains {[}1,3{]}-13C glycerol or {[}2{]}-13C glycerol to dilute the 13C spin system. Labeling schemes, which rely on heteronuclei, are insensitive both for detection and in terms of quantification of distances, since they are relying on low-? nuclei. Proton detection can in principle provide a gain in sensitivity by a factor of 8 and 31, compared to the 13C or 15N detected version of the experiment. We report here a new labeling scheme, which enables 1H-detection of aliphatic resonances with high resolution in MAS solid-state NMR spectroscopy. We prepared microcrystals of the SH3 domain of chicken \ensuremath{\alpha}-spectrin with 5\% protonation at nonexchangeable sites and obtained line widths on the order of 25 Hz for aliphatic 1H resonances. We show further that 13C resolved 3D-1H,1H correlation experiments yield access to long-range proton?proton distances in the protein.},

  abstract = {The complete nucleotide sequence of ssRNA phage AP205 propagating in Acinetobacter species is reported. The RNA has three large ORFs, which code for the following homologues of the RNA coliphage proteins: the maturation, coat and replicase proteins. Their gene order is the same as that in coliphages. RNA coliphages or Leviviridae fall into two genera: the alloleviviruses, like Q(beta), which have a coat read-through protein, and the leviviruses, like MS2, which do not have this coat protein extension. AP205 has no read-through protein and may therefore be classified as a levivirus. A major digression from the known leviviruses is the apparent absence of a lysis gene in AP205 at the usual position, overlapping the coat and replicase proteins. Instead, two small ORFs are present at the 5' terminus, preceding the maturation gene. One of these might encode a lysis protein. The other is of unknown function. Other new features concern the 3'-terminal sequence. In all ssRNA coliphages, there are always three cytosine residues at the 3' end, but in AP205, there is only a single terminal cytosine. Distantly related viruses, like AP205 and the coliphages, do not have significant sequence identity; yet, important secondary structural features of the RNA are conserved. This is shown here for the 3' UTR and the replicase-operator hairpin. Interestingly, although AP205 has the genetic map of a levivirus, its 3' UTR has the length and RNA secondary structure of an allolevivirus. Sharing features with both MS2 and Q(beta) suggests that, in an evolutionary sense, AP205 should be placed between Q(beta) and MS2. A phylogenetic tree for the ssRNA phages is presented.},

  abstract = {Preparation of proteins in their crystalline state has been found to be important in producing stable therapeutic protein formulations, cross-linked enzyme crystals for application in industrial processes, generating novel porous media for separations, and of course in structure elucidation. Of these applications only X-ray crystallography requires large crystals, defined here as being crystals 100s of microns or greater in size. Smaller crystals have attractive attributes in many instances, and are just as useful in structure determination by solid state NMR (ssNMR) as are large crystals. In this paper we outline a simple set of procedures for preparing nanocrystalline protein samples for ssNMR or other applications and describe the characterization of their crystallinity by ssNMR and X-ray powder diffraction. The approach is demonstrated in application to five different proteins: ubiquitin, lysozyme, ribonuclease A, streptavidin, and cytochrome c. In all instances the nanocrystals produced are found to be highly crystalline as judged by natural abundance 13C ssNMR and optical and electron microscopy. We show for ubiquitin that nanocrystals prepared by rapid batch crystallization yield equivalent 13C ssNMR spectra to those of larger X-ray diffraction quality crystals. Single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction measurements are made to compare the degree of order present in polycrystalline, nanocrystalline, and lyophilized ubiquitin. Solid state 13C NMR is also used to show that ubiquitin nanocrystals are thermally robust, giving no indication of loss of local order after repeated temperature cycling between liquid nitrogen and room temperature. The methods developed are rapid and should scale well from the tenths of milligram to multi-gram scales, and as such should find wide utility in the preparation of protein nanocrystals for applications in catalysis, separations, and especially in sample preparation for structural studies using ssNMR.},

These include the accurate measurement of weak dipole{\textendash}dipole couplings between rare spins, the behavior of dipolar trajectories in multiple spin environments, and chemical shiftcorrelation spectroscopy via polarization exchange. To describe dipolar trajectories accurately, we adopt an approach to the simulation of these experiments which includes finite pulses and the influence of coherence decay. The latter effect becomes competitive with the strength of weak couplings in many experiments, and a simple empirical approach is outlined for the selection of decay parameters. Dipolar trajectories are shown to be dominated by the largest couplings in multiple spin systems via comparison of two and three interacting spins. Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy based on dipolar exchange among proximate nuclei is illustrated with a uniformly 15 N , 13 C -labeled sample of the tetrapeptide achatin-II (Gly-L-Phe-L-Ala-L-Asp). In addition, a frequency-selective approach to recoupling dipolar interactions among homonuclear spins is introduced; selective approaches have possible utility in examining weak dipole{\textendash}dipole couplings in the presence of strong interactions.},

A polymerase chain reaction approach was therefore applied for sequencing the fomA gene of F. periodonticum, and nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were aligned and compared with the corresponding sequences of different strains of F. nucleatum. In all strains we found a common protein upstream of the fomA gene. The noncoding area upstream of the putative -35 region of the F. periodonticum fomA gene exhibited little sequence similarity with the F. nucleatum gene. The transcriptional unit of FomA, on the other hand, was very similar, with the similarities concentrated in domains that were interspersed with hypervariable regions. A topology model was made and compared with those made for F. nucleatum. This indicated that the great similarities reside in the membrane-spanning segments of the protein, while most cell surface exposed loops were hypervariable. The results strongly support the proposed model for FomA and also indicate that these taxa are related but on a lower level than the subspecies level. The codon usage of F. periodonticum is comparable to that of F. nucleatum, and the triplet AGA is the only codon used for arginine.},

  abstract = {Chemical shift assignment is the first step in all established protocols for structure determination of uniformly labeled proteins by NMR. The explosive growth in recent years of magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR (SSNMR) applications is largely attributable to improved methods for backbone and side-chain chemical shift correlation spectroscopy. However, the techniques developed so far have been applied primarily to proteins in the size range of 5{\textendash}10 kDa, despite the fact that SSNMR has no inherent molecular weight limits. Rather, the degeneracy inherent to many 2D and 3D SSNMR spectra of larger proteins has prevented complete unambiguous chemical shift assignment. Here we demonstrate the implementation of 4D backbone chemical shift correlation experiments for assignment of solid proteins. The experiments greatly reduce spectral degeneracy at a modest cost in sensitivity, which is accurately described by theory. We consider several possible implementations and investigate the CANCOCX pulse sequence in detail. This experiment involves three cross polarization steps, from H to CA{[}i{]}, CA{[}i{]} to N{[}i{]}, and N{[}i{]} to C\ensuremath{'}{[}i-1{]}, followed by a final homonuclear mixing period. With short homonuclear mixing times (\ensuremath{<}20 ms), backbone correlations are observed with high sensitivity; with longer mixing times (\ensuremath{>}200 ms), long-range correlations are revealed. For example, a single 4D experiment with 225 ms homonuclear mixing time reveals \ensuremath{\sim}200 uniquely resolved medium and long-range correlations in the 56-residue protein GB1. In addition to experimental demonstrations in the 56-residue protein GB1, we present a theoretical analysis of anticipated improvements in resolution for much larger proteins and compare these results in detail with the experiments, finding good agreement between experiment and theory under conditions of stable instrumental performance.},

  abstract = {Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement (PRE) can be used to accelerate NMR data acquisition by reducing the longitudinal proton relaxation time T1 in the solid state. We show that the presence of paramagnetic compounds in the bulk solvent induces a site-specific relaxation in addition to local dynamics, which is dependent on the surface accessibility of the respective amide proton in the protein. Differentiation between paramagnetic relaxation and dynamics was achieved by a comparison of 1H T1 times obtained from microcrystalline protein samples prepared with different concentrations of the CuII(edta) chelate. We find that relaxation can in addition be mediated by hydroxyl groups, which transfer relaxation by their ability to exchange with the quickly relaxing bulk solvent. Furthermore, relaxation seems to be transferred by water molecules which diffuse into the protein structure and yield an efficient difference PRE in flexible regions of the protein. The experiments are demonstrated using a perdeuterated sample of the \ensuremath{\alpha}-spectrin SH3 domain, which was microcrystallized from a buffer containing 90\% D2O. Deuteration is a prerequisite to avoid spin diffusion which would otherwise compromise site specific resolution.},

  abstract = {The amino acid composition and architecture of all \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel membrane proteins of known three-dimensional structure have been examined to generate information that will be useful in identifying \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels in genome databases. The database consists of 15 nonredundant structures, including several novel, recent structures. Known structures include monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels with between 8 and 22 membrane-spanning \ensuremath{\beta}-strands each. For this analysis the membrane-interacting surfaces of the \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels were identified with an experimentally derived, whole-residue hydrophobicity scale, and then the barrels were aligned normal to the bilayer and the position of the bilayer midplane was determined for each protein from the hydrophobicity profile. The abundance of each amino acid, relative to the genomic abundance, was calculated for the barrel exterior and interior. The architecture and diversity of known \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels was also examined. For example, the distribution of rise-per-residue values perpendicular to the bilayer plane was found to be 2.7 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.25 {\AA} per residue, or about 10 \ensuremath{\pm} 1 residues across the membrane. Also, as noted by other authors, nearly every known membrane-spanning \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel strand was found to have a short loop of seven residues or less connecting it to at least one adjacent strand. Using this information we have begun to generate rapid screening algorithms for the identification of \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel membrane proteins in genomic databases. Application of one algorithm to the genomes of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa confirms its ability to identify \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels, and reveals dozens of unidentified open reading frames that potentially code for \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel outer membrane proteins.},

  abstract = {The first-order recoupling sequence radio frequency driven dipolar recoupling (RFDR) is commonly used in single-quantum/single-quantum homonuclear correlation 2D experiments under magic angle spinning (MAS) to determine homonuclear proximities. From previously reported analysis of the use of XY-based super-cycling schemes to enhance the efficiency of the finite-pulse-RFDR (fp-RFDR) pulse sequence, XY814 phase cycling was found to provide the optimum performance for 2D correlation experiments on low-\ensuremath{\gamma} nuclei. In this study, we analyze the efficiency of different phase cycling schemes for proton-based fp-RFDR experiments. We demonstrate the advantages of using a short phase cycle, XY4, and its super-cycle XY414 that only recouples the zero-quantum homonuclear dipolar coupling, for the fp-RFDR sequence in 2D 1H/1H correlation experiments at ultrafast MAS frequencies. The dipolar recoupling efficiencies of XY4, XY414 and XY814 phase cycling schemes are compared based on results obtained from 2D 1H/1H correlation experiments, utilizing the fp-RFDR pulse sequence, on powder samples of U{\textendash}13C,15N-l-alanine, N-acetyl{\textendash}15N-l-valyl{\textendash}15N-l-leucine, and glycine. Experimental results and spin dynamics simulations show that XY414 performs the best when a high RF power is used for the 180{\textdegree} pulse, whereas XY4 renders the best performance when a low RF power is used. The effects of RF field inhomogeneity and chemical shift offsets are also examined. Overall, our results suggest that a combination of fp-RFDR-XY414 employed in the recycle delay with a large RF-field to decrease the recycle delay, and fp-RFDR-XY4 in the mixing period with a moderate RF-field, is a robust and efficient method for 2D single-quantum/single-quantum 1H/1H correlation experiments at ultrafast MAS frequencies.},

This enables combined coherence transfer and spin-state-selective excitation using very short pulse sequences compared to previous JCC coupling-based methods, which have not so far been developed for transfer of coherence between spins but only for spin state selection on the origin spin. Furthermore, coherence transfer through the much larger dipole?dipole couplings renders the experiments more forgiving with respect to the demand of very intense proton decoupling during the long excitation periods of JCC-based methods. The optimal control dipolar-driven spin-state-selective coherende transfer (OCDDS3CT) experiment doubles the resolution in the detection dimension of 2D CACO and 3D NCACO experiments, as demonstrated experimentally using uniformly 13C,15N-labeled amino acids, ubiquitin, and fibrils of the SNNFGAILSS fibrillating core of human islet amyloid polypeptide with the FGAIL part labeled with 13C and 15N.},

  abstract = {Integral membrane proteins come in two types, \ensuremath{\alpha}-helical and \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel proteins. In both types, all hydrogen bonding donors and acceptors of the polypeptide backbone are completely compensated and buried while nonpolar side chains point to the membrane. The \ensuremath{\alpha}-helical type is more abundant and occurs in cytoplasmic (or inner) membranes, whereas the \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels are known from outer membranes of bacteria. The \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel construction is described by the number of strands and the shear number, which is a measure for the inclination angle of the \ensuremath{\beta}-strands against the barrel axis. The common right-handed \ensuremath{\beta}-twist requires shear numbers slightly larger than the number of strands. Membrane protein \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels contain between 8 and 22 \ensuremath{\beta}-strands and have a simple topology that is probably enforced by the folding process. The smallest barrels form inverse micelles and work as enzymes or they bind to other macromolecules. The medium-range barrels form more or less specific pores for nutrient uptake, whereas the largest barrels occur in active Fe2+ transporters. The \ensuremath{\beta}-barrels are suitable objects for channel engineering, because the structures are simple and because many of these proteins can be produced into inclusion bodies and recovered therefrom in the exact native conformation.},

The desire to apply sophisticated multiple pulse experiments to proteins therefore motivates the development of probes that utilize the RF power more efficiently to generate a high ratio of magnetic to electric field in the sample. Here a novel scroll coil resonator structure is presented and compared to a traditional solenoid. The scroll coil is demonstrated to be more tolerant of high sample salt concentrations and cause less RF-induced sample heating. With it, the viable experimental lifetime of a microcrystalline ubiquitin sample has been extended by more than an order of magnitude. The higher B1 homogeneity and permissible decoupling fields enhance polarization transfer efficiency in 15N{\textendash}13C correlation experiments employed for protein chemical shift assignments and structure determination.},

Input to MCASSIGN2 includes lists of multidimensional signals in the NMR spectra with their possible residue-type assignments (which need not be unique), the biopolymer sequence, and a table that describes the connections that relate one signal list to another. As output, MCASSIGN2 produces a high-scoring sequential assignment of the multidimensional signals, using a score function that rewards good connections (i.e., agreement between relevant sets of chemical shifts in different signal lists) and penalizes bad connections, unassigned signals, and assignment gaps. Examination of a set of high-scoring assignments from a large number of independent runs allows one to determine whether a unique assignment exists for the entire sequence or parts thereof. We demonstrate the MCSA algorithm using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) solid state NMR spectra of several model protein samples (\ensuremath{\alpha}-spectrin SH3 domain and protein G/B1 microcrystals, HET-s218{\textendash}289 fibrils), obtained with magic-angle spinning and standard polarization transfer techniques. The MCSA algorithm and MCASSIGN2 program can accommodate arbitrary combinations of NMR spectra with arbitrary dimensionality, and can therefore be applied in many areas of solid state and solution NMR.},

  abstract = {A reliable site-specific estimate of the individual N?H bond lengths in the protein backbone is the fundamental basis of any relaxation experiment in solution and in the solid-state NMR. The N?H bond length can in principle be influenced by hydrogen bonding, which would result in an increased N?H distance. At the same time, dynamics in the backbone induces a reduction of the experimental dipolar coupling due to motional averaging. We present a 3D dipolar recoupling experiment in which the 1H,15N dipolar coupling is reintroduced in the indirect dimension using phase-inverted CP to eliminate effects from rf inhomogeneity. We find no variation of the N?H dipolar coupling as a function of hydrogen bonding. Instead, variations in the 1H,15N dipolar coupling seem to be due to dynamics of the protein backbone. This is supported by the observed correlation between the HN?N dipolar coupling and the amide proton chemical shift. The experiment is demonstrated for a perdeuterated sample of the \ensuremath{\alpha}-spectrin SH3 domain. Perdeuteration is a prerequisite to achieve high accuracy. The average error in the analysis of the H?N dipolar couplings is on the order of \ensuremath{\pm}370 Hz (\ensuremath{\pm}0.012 {\AA}) and can be as small as 150 Hz, corresponding to a variation of the bond length of \ensuremath{\pm}0.005 {\AA}.},

  abstract = {High-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopy has become a promising method for the determination of three-dimensional protein structures for systems which are difficult to crystallize or exhibit low solubility. Here we describe the structure determination of microcrystalline ubiquitin using 2D 13C13C correlation spectroscopy under magic angle spinning conditions. High-resolution 13C spectra have been acquired from hydrated microcrystals of site-directed 13C-enriched ubiquitin. Interresidue carboncarbon distance constraints defining the global protein structure have been evaluated from 'dipolar-assisted rotational resonance' experiments recorded at various mixing times. Additional constraints on the backbone torsion angles have been derived from chemical shift analysis. Using both distance and dihedral angle constraints, the structure of microcrystalline ubiquitin has been refined to a root-mean-square deviation of about 1 . The structure determination strategies for solid samples described herein are likely to be generally applicable to many proteins that cannot be studied by X-ray crystallography or solution NMR spectroscopy.},

The combination of high field and fast speed yields a 1H linewidth approaching the intrinsic limit determined by anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility.

Spin label lipid chains covalently attached to rhodopsin can also display a two-component spectrum in rod outer segment membranes. In unbleached, non-delipidated membranes the 16-doxyl stearoyl maleimide label shows an immobilized component which has an outer splitting of 59 G at 0{\textdegree}C and a considerable temperature dependence. This component which is not resolved at high temperatures (24{\textendash}35{\textdegree}C), is attributed to the lipid chains interacting directly with the monomeric protein, as with the diffusable labels. In contrast, in rod outer segment membranes which have been either delipidated or extensively bleached, a strongly immobilized component is observed with the 16-doxyl maleimide label at all temperatures. This immobilized component has an outer splitting of 62{\textendash}64 G at 0{\textdegree}C, with very little temperature dependence (61{\textendash}62 G at 35{\textdegree}C), and is attributed to protein aggregation.},

The approach is based on the rapid and sensitive acquisition of an extensive set of 15N and 13C nuclear relaxation rates. The system on which we demonstrate these methods is the enzyme Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), which coordinates a Cu ion available either in Cu+ (diamagnetic) or Cu2+ (paramagnetic) form. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancements are obtained from the difference in rates measured in the two forms and are employed as structural constraints for the determination of the protein structure. When added to 1H-1H distance restraints, they are shown to yield a twofold improvement of the precision of the structure. Site-specific order parameters and timescales of motion are obtained by a Gaussian axial fluctuation (GAF) analysis of the relaxation rates of the diamagnetic molecule, and interpreted in relation to backbone structure and metal binding. Timescales for motion are found to be in the range of the overall correlation time in solution, where internal motions characterized here would not be observable.},

This labeling pattern resulted in many long-range inter-residue cross-peaks being observed in spectra recorded with long mixing times.

In conjunction with spectra from {[}1,3-13C{]}- and {[}2-13C{]}-glycerol samples, a total of 45 reliable sequence specific assignments could be made for OmpG on the basis of this sample.},

Methods for 2D 13C13C, 15N(13C)13C, and 3D 15N13C13C chemical shift correlation spectroscopy are demonstrated in the chemotactic tripeptide N-formyl-{[}U-13C,15N{]}-Met-Leu-Phe-OH (MLF). Band-selective heteronuclear double-cross polarization (DCP) and -encoded homonuclear double-quantum mixing provide large improvements in sensitivity relative to previously published methods. Directional transfers from amide 15N to 13C' or 13C resonances provide two- to 3-fold improvements in signal intensity on the observed 13C spin, in comparison to broadband DCP. Similarly, homonuclear 13C13C transfer is enhanced by use of the rotating frame sequence SPC-5; backbone-to-side chain polarization transfers are achieved with especially high efficiency. Furthermore, the double-quantum nature of the homonuclear transfer permits straightforward classification of C', C, C, and C signals, on the basis of the sign of the cross-peaks. The experiments described here include optimized solid-state analogues of the solution-state schemes commonly employed for amino acid identification and sequential backbone assignment. We expect that these experiments will facilitate application of 2D and 3D correlation methods to assignment of larger solid peptides and proteins.},

Herein, we review methods for efficient proton detected techniques and applications in highly deuterated proteins, with an emphasis on 100\% selected 1H site concentration for the purpose of sensitivity. We discuss the factors affecting resolution and sensitivity that have resulted in higher and higher frequency MAS. Next we describe the various methods that have been used for backbone and side-chain assignment with proton detection, highlighting the efficient use of scalar-based 13C{\textendash}13C transfers. Additionally, we show new spectra making use of these schemes for side-chain assignment of methyl 13C{\textendash}1H resonances. The rapid acquisition of resolved 2D spectra with proton detection allows efficient measurement of relaxation parameters used as a measure of dynamic processes. Under rapid MAS, relaxation times can be measured in a site-specific manner in medium-sized proteins, enabling the investigation of molecular motions at high resolution. Additionally, we discuss methods for measurement of structural parameters, including measurement of internuclear 1H{\textendash}1H contacts and the use of paramagnetic effects in the determination of global structure.},

The phase diagram of the binary mixtures divides into three separate regions along the composition axis, corresponding to the formation of isothermally melting compounds with DMPC/DMG stoichiometries of approximately 1:1 and 1:2 mol/mol in the gel phase {[}Heimburg, T., W{\"u}rz, U., \& Marsh, D.

In the first region (up to 50 mol \% DMG), comparison of the chain flexibility profiles, and the chain profiles of the polarity-dependent isotropic hyperfine coupling constant, of the two different spin-labeled components indicates that DMG is incorporated in the fluid lipid bilayer in a manner similar to that of the host DMPC but is situated approximately two CH2 groups deeper into the hydrophobic interior. At lower contents of DMG, the chain packing is increased by the addition of DMG, whereas at higher DMG contents the lipid chain order decreases rapidly, on reaching the inverted hexagonal phase of the second region of the phase diagram. In the second region of the phase diagram (50?67 mol \% DMG), the DMG fits better into the fluid inverted hexagonal phase than into the fluid lamellar phase of the first region and is located only approximately one CH2 group deeper than the corresponding DMPC. In these first two regions of the phase diagram, the ESR spectra of both spin-labeled components display an axial anisotropy that evidences the increasing angular amplitude of motion with position down the chain that is characteristic of liquid crystalline fluid phases. In the third region of the phase diagram (above 67 mol \% DMG), the fluid phase consists of isotropically tumbling DMG molecules in which the DMPC molecules are incorporated as inverted micelles as indicated by the residual anisotropic motion of the spin-labeled phosphatidylcholine analogues.},

This new strategy aims to improve the efficiency of 13C spin diffusion in perdeuterated proteins. The method is called double-nucleus enhanced recoupling (DONER), and it provides significantly improved transfer efficiency for carbon spin diffusion at low proton density. The C\ensuremath{\alpha} cross-peak intensity in the DONER experiment is ?3 and ?5 times stronger than those in conventional radio-frequency-assisted diffusion (RAD) and proton-driven spin diffusion (PDSD) experiments, respectively. Remarkably, the full cross-peak pattern for the aliphatic region of an extensively perdeuterated SH3 protein sample can be obtained using the DONER approach with direct 13C excitation.},

A novel class of pulse sequences (S-AMCP) that employ an amplitude-modulated spin-lock field on the S-spin channel only and cw irradiation on the I-spin channel is introduced. It leads to efficient cross polarization at the standard Hartmann-Hahn condition while maintaining good spin-lock properties. S-AMCP does, however, not decrease the sensitivity to exact Hartmann-Hahn matching that can become critical under fast rotation. A double amplitude modulation scheme (D-AMCP) that uses amplitude modulation on both radiofrequency channels and significantly broadens the Hartmann-Hahn matching condition is presented. It can, however, be applied only to spin systems with relatively low I-spin homonuclear dipolar interactions due to the absence of an effective spin-locking field. S-AMCP pulse sequences, in contrast, are generally applicable and yield cross-polarization efficiencies that are always better than or equal to the standard continuous-wave cross-polarization experiment.},

  abstract = {The outer membrane protein G (OmpG) is a monomeric 33 kDa 14-stranded ?-barrel membrane protein functioning as a nonspecific porin for the uptake of oligosaccharides in Escherichia coli. Two different crystal structures of OmpG obtained at different values of pH suggest a pH-gated pore opening mechanism. In these structures, extracellular loop 6 extends away from the barrel wall at neutral pH but is folded back into the pore lumen at low pH, blocking transport through the pore. Loop 6 was invisible in a previously published solution NMR structure of OmpG in n-dodecylphosphocholine micelles, presumably due to conformational exchange on an intermediate NMR time scale. Here we present an NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE)-based approach to visualize the conformational dynamics of loop 6 and to calculate conformational ensembles that explain the pH-gated opening and closing of the OmpG channel. The different loop conformers detected by the PRE ensemble calculations were validated by disulfide cross-linking of strategically engineered cysteines and electrophysiological single channel recordings. The results indicate a more dynamically regulated channel opening and closing than previously thought and reveal additional membrane-associated conformational ensembles at pH 6.3 and 7.0. We anticipate this approach to be generally applicable to detect and characterize functionally important conformational ensembles of membrane proteins.},

  abstract = {A structure-function analysis of the influenza A virus M2 ion channel protein was performed. The M2 protein of human influenza virus A/Udorn/72 and mutants containing changes on one face of the putative alpha helix of the M2 transmembrane (TM) domain, several of which lead to amantadine resistance when found in virus, were expressed in oocytes of Xenopus laevis. The membrane currents of oocytes expressing mutant M2 ion channels were measured at both normal and low pH, and the amantadine-resistant mutant containing the change of alanine at residue 30 to threonine was found to have a significantly attenuated low pH activation response. The specific activity of the channel current of the amantadine-resistant mutants was investigated by measuring the membrane current of individual oocytes followed by quantification of the amount of M2 protein expressed in these single oocytes by immunoblotting analysis. The data indicate that changing residues on this face of the putative alpha helix of the M2 TM domain alters properties of the M2 ion channel. Some of the M2 proteins containing changes in the TM domain were found to be modified by addition of an N-linked carbohydrate chain at an asparagine residue that is membrane proximal and which is not modified in the wild-type M2 protein. These N-linked carbohydrate chains were further modified by addition of polylactosaminoglycan. A glycosylated M2 mutant protein (M2 + V, A30T) exhibited an ion channel activity with a voltage-activated, time-dependent kinetic component. Prevention of carbohydrate addition did not affect the altered channel activity. The ability of the M2 protein to tolerate deletions in the TM domain was examined by expressing three mutants (del29-31, del28-31, and del27-31) containing deletions of three, four, and five residues in the TM domain. No ion channel activity was detected from expression of M2 del29-31 and del27-31, whereas expression of M2 del28-31 resulted in an ion channel activity that was activated by hyperpolarization (and not low pH) and was resistant to amantadine block. Examination of the oligomeric form of M2 del28-31 indicated that the oligomer is different from wild-type M2, and the data were consistent with M2 del28-31 forming a pentamer.},

  abstract = {Magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) is well suited for the study of membrane proteins in membrane mimetic and native membrane environments. These experiments often suffer from low sensitivity, due in part to the long recycle delays required for magnetization and probe recovery, as well as detection of low gamma nuclei. In ultrafast MAS experiments sensitivity can be enhanced through the use of low power sequences combined with paramagnetically enhanced relaxation times to reduce recycle delays, as well as proton detected experiments. In this work we investigate the sensitivity of 13C and 1H detected experiments applied to 27 kDa membrane proteins reconstituted in lipids and packed in small 1.3 mm MAS NMR rotors. We demonstrate that spin diffusion is sufficient to uniformly distribute paramagnetic relaxation enhancement provided by either covalently bound or dissolved CuEDTA over 7TM alpha helical membrane proteins. Using paramagnetic enhancement and low power decoupling in carbon detected experiments we can recycle experiments {\textasciitilde}13 times faster than under traditional conditions. However, due to the small sample volume the overall sensitivity per unit time is still lower than that seen in the 3.2 mm probe. Proton detected experiments, however, showed increased efficiency and it was found that the 1.3 mm probe could achieve sensitivity comparable to that of the 3.2 mm in a given amount of time. This is an attractive prospect for samples of limited quantity, as this allows for a reduction in the amount of protein that needs to be produced without the necessity for increased experimental time.},

Extensive deuteration of the protein allows multidimensional experiments with exceptionally high sensitivity and resolution to be obtained. Here we present an experimental strategy to measure highly unambiguous spatial correlations for distances up to 13 {\AA}. Two complementary three-dimensional experiments, or alternatively a four-dimensional experiment, yield highly unambiguous cross-peak assignments, which rely on four encoded chemical shift dimensions. Correlations to residual aliphatic protons are accessible via synchronous evolution of the 15N and 13C chemical shifts, which encode valuable amide?methyl distance restraints. On average, we obtain six restraints per residue. Importantly, 50\% of all restraints correspond to long-range distances between residues i and j with |i ? j| \ensuremath{>} 5, which are of particular importance in structure calculations. Using ARIA, we calculate a high-resolution structure for the microcrystalline 7.2 kDa \ensuremath{\alpha}-spectrin SH3 domain with a backbone precision of ?1.1 {\AA}.},

Using EDTA-Cu2+-modified K28C and N8C mutants of the B1 immunoglobulin binding domain of protein G as models, we demonstrate that high resolution and sensitivity 2D and 3D SSNMR chemical shift correlation spectra can be recorded in as little as several minutes and several hours, respectively, for samples containing ?0.1?0.2 ?mol of 13C,15N- or 2H,13C,15N-labeled protein. This mode of data acquisition is naturally suited toward the structural SSNMR studies of paramagnetic proteins, for which the typical 1H longitudinal relaxation time constants are inherently a factor of at least ?3?4 lower relative to their diamagnetic counterparts. To illustrate this, we demonstrate the rapid site-specific determination of backbone amide 15N longitudinal paramagnetic relaxation enhancements using a pseudo-3D SSNMR experiment based on 15N?13C correlation spectroscopy, and we show that such measurements yield valuable long-range 15N?Cu2+ distance restraints which report on the three-dimensional protein fold.},

  abstract = {Membrane proteins mediate many critical functions in cells. Determining their three-dimensional structures in the native lipid environment has been one of the main objectives in structural biology. There are two major NMR methodologies that allow this objective to be accomplished. Oriented sample NMR, which can be applied to membrane proteins that are uniformly aligned in the magnetic field, has been successful in determining the backbone structures of a handful of membrane proteins. Owing to methodological and technological developments, Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy has emerged as another major technique for the complete characterization of the structure and dynamics of membrane proteins. First developed on peptides and small microcrystalline proteins, MAS ssNMR has recently been successfully applied to large membrane proteins. In this review we describe recent progress in MAS ssNMR methodologies, which are now available for studies of membrane protein structure determination, and outline a few examples, which highlight the broad capability of ssNMR spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {The use of small rotors capable of very fast magic-angle spinning (MAS) in conjunction with proton dilution by perdeuteration and partial reprotonation at exchangeable sites has enabled the acquisition of resolved, proton detected, solid-state NMR spectra on samples of biological macromolecules. The ability to detect the high-gamma protons, instead of carbons or nitrogens, increases sensitivity. In order to achieve sufficient resolution of the amide proton signals, rotors must be spun at the maximum rate possible given their size and the proton back-exchange percentage tuned. Here we investigate the optimal proton back-exchange ratio for triply labeled SH3 at 40 kHz MAS. We find that spectra acquired on 60 \% back-exchanged samples in 1.9 mm rotors have similar resolution at 40 kHz MAS as spectra of 100 \% back-exchanged samples in 1.3 mm rotors spinning at 60 kHz MAS, and for (H)NH 2D and (H)CNH 3D spectra, show 10{\textendash}20 \% higher sensitivity. For 100 \% back-exchanged samples, the sensitivity in 1.9 mm rotors is superior by a factor of 1.9 in (H)NH and 1.8 in (H)CNH spectra but at lower resolution. For (H)C(C)NH experiments with a carbon{\textendash}carbon mixing period, this sensitivity gain is lost due to shorter relaxation times and less efficient transfer steps. We present a detailed study on the sensitivity of these types of experiments for both types of rotors, which should enable experimentalists to make an informed decision about which type of rotor is best for specific applications.},

The experiments are demonstrated for a uniformly 2H, 15N labeled sample of a microcrystalline SH3 domain in which exchangeable deuterons were back-substituted with protons. In order to evaluate the NMR experimental data, as X-ray structure of the protein was determined using the same crystallization protocol as for the solid-state NMR sample.

Here we report a high-performance solvent suppression method that attenuates multiple solvent signals simultaneously by more than a factor of 10,000, achieved by an optimized combination of homospoil gradients and supercycled saturation pulses. This method, which we call Multiple Intense Solvent Suppression Intended for Sensitive Spectroscopic Investigation of Protonated Proteins, Instantly (MISSISSIPPI), can be applied without a PFG probe.

The deduced amino acid sequences of these two proteins were aligned with the amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein of F. nucleatum strain Fev1 and examined for conserved/variable polypeptide segments. A model for the topology of the 40-kDa OMPs is proposed on the basis of this alignment and application of the structural principles derived for OMPs of Escherichia coli. According to this model, sixteen polypeptide segments, which are highly conserved, traverse the outer membrane, thereby creating eight external loops, most of which are highly variable.},

Recently, we introduced the RAP (Reduced Adjoining Protonation) labeling scheme, which allows to detect backbone and sidechain protons with high sensitivity and resolution. We present here a 1H-detected 3D (H)CCH experiment for assignment of backbone and sidechain proton resonances. Resolution is significantly improved by employing simultaneous 13CO and 13C\ensuremath{\beta} J-decoupling during evolution of the 13C\ensuremath{\alpha} chemical shift.

The method is validated with five examples of proteins in different condensed states, including two microcrystalline proteins, a sedimented virus capsid, and two membrane-embedded systems.

However, most membrane proteins are unstable when solubilized and hence often not accessible to NMR or X-ray crystallography. The atomic force microscope (AFM) is a powerful tool for imaging and manipulating membrane proteins in their native state. Superb images of native membranes have been recorded, and a quantitative interpretation of the data acquired using the AFM tip has become possible. In addition, multifunctional probes to simultaneously acquire information on the topography and electrical properties of membrane proteins have been produced. This progress is discussed here and fosters expectations for future developments and applications of AFM and single-molecule force spectroscopy.},

The high spectral quality achieved after partial proton back-exchange has been shown to start a new era for backbone assignment, protein structure elucidation, characterization of protein dynamics, and access to protein parts undergoing motion. The large absence of protons at non-exchangeable sites, however, poses a serious hurdle for characterization of side chains, which play an important role especially for structural understanding of the protein core and the investigation of protein{\textendash}protein and protein{\textendash}ligand interactions, e.g. This has caused the perdeuteration approach to almost exclusively be amenable to backbone characterization only. In this work it is shown that a combination of isotropic 13C mixing with long-range 1H/13C magnetization transfers can be used effectively to also access complete sets of side-chain chemical shifts in perdeuterated proteins and correlate these with the protein backbone with high unambiguity and resolution. COmbined POlarization from long-Range transfers And Direct Excitation (COPORADE) allows this strategy to yield complete sets of aliphatic amino acid resonances with reasonable sensitivity.},

Today, B0 gradients are employed routinely in solution-state NMR for coherence order selection and solvent suppression. We suggest to use gradients to purge water magnetization which cannot be suppressed using conventional water suppression schemes. The achievable gain in sensitivity for 1H detection is in the order of 5 compared to the 15N detected version of the experiment (at a MAS rotation frequency of 13.5 kHz). We expect that this labeling concept which achieves high sensitivity due to 1H detection, in combination with the possibility to measure long range 1H1H distances as we have shown previously, to be a useful tool for the determination of protein structures in the solid state.},

Proteins produced with {[}1-13C{]}- or {[}2-13C{]}glucose are very sparsely labeled, and the resulting 2D ssNMR spectra exhibit smaller line widths (by a factor of ?2 relative to uniformly labeled proteins) and contain a reduced number of cross-peaks. This allows for an accelerated and straightforward resonance assignment without the necessity of time-consuming 3D spectroscopy or sophisticated pulse sequences. The strategy aims at complete backbone and side-chain resonance assignments based on bidirectional sequential walks. The approach was successfully demonstrated with the de novo assignment of the Type Three Secretion System PrgI needle protein. Using a limited set of simple 2D experiments, we report a 97\% complete resonance assignment of the backbone and side-chain 13C atoms.},

The outer membrane protein OmpA and the ferrichrome?iron receptor FhuA from the outer membrane of Escherichia coli were reconstituted in bilayers of dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol. The ESR spectra from phosphatidylglycerol spin labeled on the 14-C atom of the sn-2 chain contain a second component from motionally restricted lipids contacting the intramembranous surface of the ?-barrel, in addition to that from the fluid bilayer lipids. The stoichiometry of motionally restricted lipids, 11 and 32 lipids/monomer for OmpA and FhuA, respectively, is constant irrespective of the total lipid/protein ratio. It is proportional to the number of transmembrane ?-strands, eight for OmpA and 22 for FhuA, and correlates reasonably well with the intramembranous perimeter of the protein. Spin-labeled lipids with different polar headgroups display a differential selectivity of interaction with the two proteins. The more pronounced pattern of lipid selectivity for FhuA than for OmpA correlates with the preponderance of positively charged residues facing the lipids in the extensions of the ?-sheet and shorter interconnecting loops on the extracellular side of FhuA.},

A more extensive model based on a scaling parameter that includes \ensuremath{\delta} is presented. This model complements other existing circuit models that represent sample losses, ground-loop and parasitic losses, and the signal induced in the RF coil. Experimental verification is accomplished using a series of solenoidal microcoils in 1H NMR microspectroscopy experiments at 4.7 T (200 MHz).

  abstract = {AbstractThe lipid bilayer component of biological membranes is important for the distribution, organization, and function of bilayer-spanning proteins. This regulation is due to both specific lipid-protein interactions and general bilayer-protein interactions, which modulate the energetics and kinetics of protein conformational transitions, as well as the protein distribution between different membrane compartments. The bilayer regulation of membrane protein function arises from the hydrophobic coupling between the protein's hydrophobic domains and the bilayer hydrophobic core, which causes protein conformational changes that involve the protein/bilayer boundary to perturb the adjacent bilayer. Such bilayer perturbations, or deformations, incur an energetic cost, which for a given conformational change varies as a function of the bilayer material properties (bilayer thickness, intrinsic lipid curvature, and the elastic compression and bending moduli). Protein function therefore is regulated by changes in bilayer material properties, which determine the free-energy changes caused by the protein-induced bilayer deformation. The lipid bilayer thus becomes an allosteric regulator of membrane function.},

FomA was isolated from F. nucleatum strains Fev1, ATCC 10953, and ATCC 25586 by extraction with lithium dodecyl sulfate and lithium chloride and had an apparent molecular mass of about 40 kDa. When solubilized at low temperatures, the protein ran with an apparent molecular mass of about 62 kDa on SDS/PAGE. Cross-linking experiments and two-dimensional SDS/PAGE gave evidence that the 62-kDa protein band represented the trimeric form of FomA. The protein trimers were susceptible to SDS and temperature. The stability of the porin trimers varied among the strains. The properties of the FomA channels were studied in reconstitution experiments with black lipid bilayer membranes. The F. nucleatum porins formed channels with single-channel conductances in the range 0.66{\textendash}1.30 nS in 1 M KCl. The single-channel conductance was a function of the mobilities of the ions present in the aqueous solution bathing the bilayer membrane. This means that FomA forms general diffusion channels since (a) the conductance showed a linear dependence on the salt concentration, (b) the ion selectivity was small and varied for the three strains, and (c) the channels did not exhibit any binding site for maltotriose or triglycine. The water-filled channel was voltage dependent, and conductance decrements were observed at transmembrane potentials of \ensuremath{\pm} 50 mV. The conductance decrement steps were about one-third of the total conductance of a functional unit in its fully `open' state. This strongly suggests that the trimer is the functional unit of the porin.},

  abstract = {The development of 15N, 13C, 2H multidimensional NMR spectroscopy has facilitated the assignment of backbone and side chain resonances of proteins and protein complexes with molecular masses of over 30 kDa. The success of these methods has been achieved through the production of highly deuterated proteins; replacing carbon-bound protons with deuterons significantly improves the sensitivity of many of the experiments used in chemical shift assignment. Unfortunately, uniform deuteration also radically depletes the number of interproton distance restraints available for structure determination, degrading the quality of the resulting structures. Here we describe an approach for improving the precision and accuracy of global folds determined from highly deuterated proteins through the use of deuterated, selectively methyl-protonated samples. This labeling profile maintains the efficiency of triple-resonance NMR experiments while retaining a sufficient number of protons at locations where they can be used to establish NOE-based contacts between different elements of secondary structure. We evaluate how this deuteration scheme affects the sensitivity and resolution of experiments used to assign 15N, 13C, and 1H chemical shifts and interproton NOEs. This approach is tested experimentally on a 14 kDa SH2/phosphopeptide complex, and a global protein fold is obtained from a set of methyl?methyl, methyl?NH, and NH?NH distance restraints. We demonstrate that the inclusion of methyl?NH and methyl?methyl distance restraints greatly improves the precision and accuracy of structures relative to those generated with only NH?NH distance restraints. Finally, we examine the general applicability of this approach by determining the structures of several proteins with molecular masses of up to 40 kDa from simulated distance and dihedral angle restraint tables.},

In the present implementation, J-UNIO makes use of APSY-NMR spectroscopy, 3D heteronuclear-resolved {[}1H,1H{]}-NOESY experiments, and the software UNIO. Applications with proteins from the JCSG target list with sizes up to 150 residues showed that the procedure is highly robust and efficient. In all instances the correct polypeptide fold was obtained in the first round of automated data analysis and structure calculation. After interactive validation of the data obtained from the automated routine, the quality of the final structures was comparable to results from interactive structure determination. Special advantages are that the NMR data have been recorded with 6{\textendash}10 days of instrument time per protein, that there is only a single step of chemical shift adjustments to relate the backbone signals in the APSY-NMR spectra with the corresponding backbone signals in the NOESY spectra, and that the NOE-based amino acid side chain chemical shift assignments are automatically focused on those residues that are heavily weighted in the structure calculation. The individual working steps of J-UNIO are illustrated with the structure determination of the protein YP\_926445.1 from Shewanella amazonensis, and the results obtained with 17 JCSG targets are critically evaluated.},

  abstract = {We describe a magic-angle spinning NMR experiment for selective 13C15N distance measurements in uniformly 13C,15N-labeled solids, where multiple 13C15N and 13C13C interactions complicate the accurate measurement of structurally interesting, weak 13C15N dipolar couplings. The new experiment, termed FSR (frequency selective REDOR), combines the REDOR pulse sequence with a frequency selective spinecho to recouple a single 13C15N dipolar interaction in a multiple spin system. Concurrently the remaining 13C15N dipolar couplings and all 13C13C scalar couplings to the selected 13C are suppressed. The 13C15N coupling of interest is extracted by a least-squares fit of the experimentally observed modulation of the 13C spinecho intensity to the analytical expression describing the dipolar dephasing in an isolated heteronuclear spin pair under conventional REDOR. The experiment is demonstrated in three uniformly 13C,15N-labeled model systems: asparagine, N-acetyl-l-Val-l-Leu and N-formyl-l-Met-l-Leu-l-Phe; in N-formyl-{[}U-13C,15N{]}l-Met-l-Leu-l-Phe we have determined a total of 16 internuclear distances in the 2.56 range.},

  abstract = {The interactions of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) with the periplasmic chaperone Skp from Escherichia coli are not well understood. We have examined the binding of Skp to various OMPs of different origin, size, and function. These were OmpA, OmpG, and YaeT (Omp85) from Escherichia coli, the translocator domain of the autotransporter NalP from Neisseria meningitides, FomA from Fusobacterium nucleatum, and the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel, human isoform 1 (hVDAC1) from mitochondria. Binding of Skp was observed for bacterial OMPs, but neither for hVDAC1 nor for soluble bovine serum albumin. The Skp trimer formed 1:1 complexes, OMP\ensuremath{\cdot}Skp3, with bacterial OMPs, independent of their size or origin. The dissociation constants of these OMP\ensuremath{\cdot}Skp3 complexes were all in the nanomolar range, indicating that they are stable. Complexes of Skp3 with YaeT displayed the smallest dissociation constants, complexes with NalP the largest. OMP binding to Skp3 was pH-dependent and not observed when either Skp or OMPs were neutralized at very basic or very acidic pH. When the ionic strength was increased, the free energies of binding of Skp to OmpA or OmpG were reduced. Electrostatic interactions were therefore necessary for formation and stability of OMP\ensuremath{\cdot}Skp3 complexes. Light-scattering and circular dichroism experiments demonstrated that Skp3 remained a stable trimer from pH 3 to pH 11. In the OmpA\ensuremath{\cdot}Skp3 complex, Skp efficiently shielded tryptophan residues of the transmembrane strands of OmpA against fluorescence quenching by aqueous acrylamide. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, bound to OmpA\ensuremath{\cdot}Skp3 complexes at low stoichiometries. Acrylamide quenching of fluorescence indicated that in this ternary complex, the tryptophan residues of the transmembrane domain of OmpA were located closer to the surface than in binary OmpA\ensuremath{\cdot}Skp3 complexes. This may explain previous observations that folding of Skp-bound OmpA into lipid bilayers is facilitated in presence of LPS.},

  abstract = {The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria contains a large number of channel proteins that mediate the uptake of ions and nutrients necessary for growth and functioning of the cell. An important group of OM channel proteins are the porins, which mediate the non-specific, diffusion-based passage of small (\&lt;600 Da) polar molecules. All porins of Gram-negative bacteria that have been crystallized to date form stable trimers, with each monomer composed of a 16-stranded \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel with a relatively narrow central pore. In contrast, the OmpG porin is unique, as it appears to function as a monomer. We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of OmpG from Escherichia coli to a resolution of 2.3 {\AA}. The structure shows a 14-stranded \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel with a relatively simple architecture. Due to the absence of loops that fold back into the channel, OmpG has a large (\ensuremath{\sim}13 {\AA}) central pore that is considerably wider than those of other E. coli porins, and very similar in size to that of the toxin \ensuremath{\alpha}-hemolysin. The architecture of the channel, together with previous biochemical and other data, suggests that OmpG may form a non-specific channel for the transport of larger oligosaccharides. The structure of OmpG provides the starting point for engineering studies aiming to generate selective channels and for the development of biosensors.},

  abstract = {Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of Escherichia coli is a \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel membrane protein that unfolds in 8 M urea to a random coil. OmpA refolds upon urea dilution in the presence of certain detergents or lipids. To examine the minimal requirements for secondary and tertiary structure formation in \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel membrane proteins, folding of OmpA was studied as a function of the hydrophobic chain length, the chemical structure of the polar headgroup, and the concentration of a large array of amphiphiles. OmpA folded in the presence of detergents only above a critical minimal chain length of the apolar chain as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy and a SDS-PAGE assay that measures tertiary structure formation. Details of the chemical structure of the polar headgroup were unimportant for folding. The minimal chain length required for folding correlated with the critical micelle concentration in each detergent series. Therefore, OmpA requires preformed detergent micelles for folding and does not adsorb monomeric detergent to its perimeter after folding. Formation of secondary and tertiary structure is thermodynamically coupled and strictly dependent on the interaction with aggregated amphiphiles.},

  abstract = {The process of resonance assignment represents a time-consuming and potentially error-prone bottleneck in structural studies of proteins by solid-state NMR (ssNMR). Software for the automation of this process is therefore of high interest. Procedures developed through the last decades for solution-state NMR are not directly applicable for ssNMR due to the inherently lower data quality caused by lower sensitivity and broader lines, leading to overlap between peaks. Recently, the first efforts towards procedures specifically aimed for ssNMR have been realized (Schmidt et al. in J Biomol NMR 56(3):243{\textendash}254, 2013). Here we present a robust automatic method, which can accurately assign protein resonances using peak lists from a small set of simple 2D and 3D ssNMR experiments, applicable in cases with low sensitivity. The method is demonstrated on three uniformly 13C, 15N labeled biomolecules with different challenges on the assignments. In particular, for the immunoglobulin binding domain B1 of streptococcal protein G automatic assignment shows 100 \% accuracy for the backbone resonances and 91.8 \% when including all side chain carbons. It is demonstrated, by using a procedure for generating artificial spectra with increasing line widths, that our method, GAMES\_ASSIGN can handle a significant amount of overlapping peaks in the assignment. The impact of including different ssNMR experiments is evaluated as well.},

In an NMRPipe processing scheme, a stream of spectral data flows through a pipeline of processing programs, each of which performs one component of the overall scheme, such as Fourier transformation or linear prediction. Complete multidimensional processing schemes are constructed as simple UNIX shell scripts. The processing modules themselves maintain and exploit accurate records of data sizes, detection modes, and calibration information in all dimensions, so that schemes can be constructed without the need to explicitly define or anticipate data sizes or storage details of real and imaginary channels during processing. The asynchronous pipeline scheme provides other substantial advantages, including high flexibility, favorable processing speeds, choice of both all-in-memory and disk-bound processing, easy adaptation to different data formats, simpler software development and maintenance, and the ability to distribute processing tasks on multi-CPU computers and computer networks.},

The selectivity and extensiveness of labeling significantly simplify the solid-state NMR spectra, reduce line broadening, and should permit the simultaneous measurement of multiple structural constraints. We show the assignment of most 13C resonances to specific amino acid types based on the characteristic chemical shifts, the 13C labeling pattern, and the amino acid composition of the protein. The assignment is partly confirmed by a 2D homonuclear double-quantum-filter experiment under magic-angle spinning. The high sensitivity and spectral resolution attained with this 13C-labeling protocol, which is termed TEASE for ten-amino acid selective and extensive labeling, are demonstrated.},

The inverse of this relation is used to search a database for triplets of adjacent residues with secondary chemical shifts and sequence similarity which provide the best match to the query triplet of interest. The database contains 13C\ensuremath{\alpha}, 13C\ensuremath{\beta}, 13C\ensuremath{'}, 1H\ensuremath{\alpha} and 15N chemical shifts for 20 proteins for which a high resolution X-ray structure is available. The computer program TALOS was developed to search this database for strings of residues with chemical shift and residue type homology. The relative importance of the weighting factors attached to the secondary chemical shifts of the five types of resonances relative to that of sequence similarity was optimized empirically. TALOS yields the 10 triplets which have the closest similarity in secondary chemical shift and amino acid sequence to those of the query sequence. If the central residues in these 10 triplets exhibit similar \ensuremath{\varphi} and \ensuremath{\Psi} backbone angles, their averages can reliably be used as angular restraints for the protein whose structure is being studied. Tests carried out for proteins of known structure indicate that the root-mean-square difference (rmsd) between the output of TALOS and the X-ray derived backbone angles is about 15{\textdegree}. Approximately 3\% of the predictions made by TALOS are found to be in error.},

  abstract = {A detailed study of the factors determining the linewidth (and hence resolution) in H 1 solid-state magic-angle spinning NMR is described. Although it has been known from the early days of magic-angle spinning (MAS) that resolution of spectra from abundant nuclear spins, such as H 1 , increases approximately linearly with increasing sample rotation rate, the difficulty of describing the dynamics of extended networks of coupled spins has made it difficult to predict a priori the resolution expected for a given sample. Using recently developed, highly efficient methods of numerical simulation, together with experimental measurements on a variety of test systems, we propose a comprehensive picture of H 1 resolution under MAS. The ``homogeneous'' component of the linewidth is shown to depend primarily on the ratio between an effective local coupling strength and the spin rate, modified by geometrical factors which loosely correspond to the ``dimensionality'' of the coupling network. The remaining ``inhomogeneous'' component of the natural linewidth is confirmed to have the same properties as in dilute-spin NMR. Variations in the NMR frequency due to chemical shift effects are shown to have minimal impact on H 1 resolution. The implications of these results for solid-state NMR experiments involving H 1 and other abundant-spin nuclei are discussed.},

  abstract = {Assignment of proteins in MAS (magic angle spinning) solid-state NMR relies so far on correlations among heteronuclei. This strategy is based on well dispersed resonances in the 15N dimension. In many complex cases like membrane proteins or amyloid fibrils, an additional frequency dimension is desirable in order to spread the amide resonances. We show here that proton detected HNCO, HNCA, and HNCACB type experiments can successfully be implemented in the solid-state. Coherences are sufficiently long lived to allow pulse schemes of a duration greater than 70 ms before incrementation of the first indirect dimension. The achieved resolution is comparable to the resolution obtained in solution-state NMR experiments. We demonstrate the experiments using a triply labeled sample of the SH3 domain of chicken \ensuremath{\alpha}-spectrin, which was re-crystallized in H2O/D2O using a ratio of 1/9. We employ paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) using EDTA chelated CuII to enable rapid data acquisition.},

An essential part of the T3SS is a hollow needle-like protein filament through which effector proteins are injected into eukaryotic host cells. Currently, the three-dimensional structure of the needle is unknown because it is not amenable to X-ray crystallography and solution NMR, as a result of its inherent non-crystallinity and insolubility. Cryo-electron microscopy combined with crystal or solution NMR subunit structures has recently provided a powerful hybrid approach for studying supramolecular assemblies, resulting in low-resolution and medium-resolution models. However, such approaches cannot deliver atomic details, especially of the crucial subunit{\textendash}subunit interfaces, because of the limited cryo-electron microscopic resolution obtained in these studies. Here we report an alternative approach combining recombinant wild-type needle production, solid-state NMR, electron microscopy and Rosetta modelling to reveal the supramolecular interfaces and ultimately the complete atomic structure of the Salmonella typhimurium T3SS needle. We show that the 80-residue subunits form a right-handed helical assembly with roughly 11 subunits per two turns, similar to that of the flagellar filament of S. typhimurium. In contrast to established models of the needle in which the amino terminus of the protein subunit was assumed to be \ensuremath{\alpha}-helical and positioned inside the needle, our model reveals an extended amino-terminal domain that is positioned on the surface of the needle, while the highly conserved carboxy terminus points towards the lumen.},

The gate of the OmpA channel is formed by the central Glu52-Arg138 salt bridge, which can open to form alternate ion pairs with Lys82 and Glu128. To gain deeper insight into the channel-opening mechanism, we measured interaction energies between the relevant side chains by double-mutant cycle analysis and correlated these with the channel activities of corresponding point mutants. The closed central salt bridge has a strong interaction energy of -5.6 kcal mol-1, which can be broken by forming the open-state salt bridge Glu52-Lys82 (\ensuremath{{\Delta}{\Delta}}GInter = -3.5 kcal mol-1) and a weak interaction between Arg138 and Glu128 (\ensuremath{{\Delta}{\Delta}}GInter = -0.6 kcal mol-1). A covalent disulfide bond in place of the central salt bridge completely blocks the channel. Growth assays indicate that this gating mechanism could physiologically contribute to the osmoprotection of Escherichia coli cells from environmental stress.},

Application of the method is limited to very robust samples, for which sample stability is not compromised by RF induced heating. In addition, probe integrity might be perturbed in standard MAS PRE experiments due to the use of very short duty cycles. We show that these deleterious effects can be avoided if perdeuterated proteins are employed that have been re-crystallized from D2O:H2O = 9:1 containing buffer solutions. The experiments are demonstrated using the SH3 domain of chicken \ensuremath{\alpha}-spectrin as a model system. The labeling scheme allows to record proton detected 1H, 15N correlation spectra with very high resolution in the absence of heteronuclear dipolar decoupling. Cu{\textendash}edta as a doping reagent yields a reduction of the recycle delay by up to a factor of 15. In particular, we find that the 1H T1 for the bulk HN magnetization is reduced from 4.4 s to 0.3 s if the Cu{\textendash}edta concentration is increased from 0 mM to 250 mM. Possible perturbations like chemical shift changes or line broadening due to the paramagnetic chelate complex are minimal. No degradation of our samples was observed in the course of the experiments.},

  abstract = {OmpG, a porin from E. coli, has been examined in planar lipid bilayers and in detergent solution. First, bilayer recordings were used to reinforce the evidence that the functional form of OmpG is a monomer. Both pH-dependent gating and blockade by covalent modification add support to this proposal. The findings contrast with the properties of the classical porins, which function as trimers. Second, the folding of OmpG in detergent solution was examined. A water-soluble form of OmpG was obtained by dialysis from denaturant into buffer. Incubation of water-soluble OmpG in detergent results in conversion to a form that possesses the hallmarks of a ? barrel. The folding of water-soluble OmpG in detergent was monitored by circular dichroism, protease resistance, and heat modifiability. OmpG is first transformed into an intermediate with increased ?-sheet content on the time scale of minutes at 23 {\textdegree}C. This is followed by the slow acquisition of heat modifiability and protease resistance over several hours. The formation of a ? barrel during this period was demonstrated in a double cysteine mutant by using intramolecular disulfide bond formation to report N and C terminus proximity. Finally, conditions are presented for folding OmpG with greater than 90\% efficiency, thereby paving the way for structural studies.},

The total line broadening has been separated into its Gaussian and Lorentzian components. The Gaussian linewidth exhibits exchange narrowing of the unresolved proton hyperfine structure, with an approximate quadratic concentration dependence for the square of the linewidth, over this spin-label concentration range. The Lorentzian linewidth has a linear dependence on the spin-label concentration over the same range. The temperature dependence of the gradient of the Lorentzian broadening with respect to spin-label concentration is biphasic over the range 30{\textendash}80{\textdegree}C, indicating a dominant contribution from magnetic dipole-dipole broadening at the lower temperatures. The contributions from the dipole-dipole and exchange interactions to the Lorentzian broadening have been separated by fitting the temperature dependence using an unconstrained optimization procedure and assuming a single effective activation energy for both diffusion-controlled processes. The lipid lateral diffusion coefficient has been determined from the concentration dependence of both the exchange broadening of the nitrogen hyperfine structure and the exchange narrowing of the proton hyperfine structure using a two-dimensional lattice diffusion model, and also from the concentration dependence of the dipole-dipole interaction using a three-dimensional Fick's law diffusion model. All three methods yield consistent values for the diffusion coefficient, although because of the approximate nature of some of the theoretical models the exchange broadening is expected to give the most reliable results. An experimental protocol for determining the actual spin concentration in the membrane sample is also presented.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Transmembrane \ensuremath{\beta} barrel proteins (TMBs) are found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, chloroplast and mitochondria. They play a major role in the translocation machinery, pore formation, membrane anchoring and ion exchange. TMBs are also promising targets for antimicrobial drugs and vaccines. Given the difficulty in membrane protein structure determination, computational methods to identify TMBs and predict the topology of TMBs are important.
Results: Here, we present BOCTOPUS; an improved method for the topology prediction of TMBs by employing a combination of support vector machines (SVMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The SVMs and HMMs account for local and global residue preferences, respectively. Based on a 10-fold cross-validation test, BOCTOPUS performs better than all existing methods, reaching a Q3 accuracy of 87\%.

  abstract = {We review the current state of membrane protein structure determination using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Multidimensional magic-angle-spinning correlation NMR combined with oriented-sample experiments has made it possible to measure a full panel of structural constraints of membrane proteins directly in lipid bilayers. These constraints include torsion angles, interatomic distances, oligomeric structure, protein dynamics, ligand structure and dynamics, and protein orientation and depth of insertion in the lipid bilayer. Using solid-state NMR, researchers have studied potassium channels, proton channels, Ca2+ pumps, G protein{\textendash}coupled receptors, bacterial outer membrane proteins, and viral fusion proteins to elucidate their mechanisms of action. Many of these membrane proteins have also been investigated in detergent micelles using solution NMR. Comparison of the solid-state and solution NMR structures provides important insights into the effects of the solubilizing environment on membrane protein structure and dynamics.},

On the basis of the conserved structures of K+ pore regions and scorpion toxins, detailed structures for the K+ channel{\textendash}scorpion toxin binding interface have been proposed. In these models and in previous solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies using detergent-solubilized membrane proteins, scorpion toxins were docked to the extracellular entrance of the K+ channel pore assuming rigid, preformed binding sites. Using high-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopy, here we show that high-affinity binding of the scorpion toxin kaliotoxin to a chimaeric K+ channel (KcsA-Kv1.3) is associated with significant structural rearrangements in both molecules. Our approach involves a combined analysis of chemical shifts and proton{\textendash}proton distances and demonstrates that solid-state NMR is a sensitive method for analysing the structure of a membrane protein{\textendash}inhibitor complex. We propose that structural flexibility of the K+ channel and the toxin represents an important determinant for the high specificity of toxin{\textendash}K+ channel interactions.},

In particular, samples of biological macromolecules, which usually contain salts to keep the pH constant and to prevent aggregation, can experience a significant reduction in sensitivity. So far this dependence has forced researchers to minimize the salt concentrations in their samples. Here we demonstrate that the decisive factor is not the salt concentration itself but the conductivity which is a function of both the concentration and the mobility of the ions in solution. We show that by choosing buffers with low ionic mobility, the sample conductivity can be dramatically reduced and the sensitivity substantially enhanced compared to the same measurement with an equal concentration of a standard NMR buffer such as phosphate. We further show that the highest sensitivity gain of one buffer over another buffer is equal to the square root of the ratio of their ion mobilities and describe a simple method to evaluate the effect of a certain buffer on the sensitivity.},

The presence of OmpG allows growth on maltodextrins in the absence of the LamB maltoporin. The data obtained from in vivo growth and uptake experiments suggested that the presence of the OmpG protein results in an increase in outer membrane permeability for small hydrophilic compounds. In light of these findings, we suggest that OmpG is a porinlike protein. The mutation which results in the expression of OmpG has been termed cog (for control of OmpG) and mapped to 29 min on the E. coli chromosome. Diploid analysis shows that the mutant cog-192 allele is recessive for both the Dex+ and OmpG+ phenotypes. We propose that the cog mutation destroys a negative regulatory function and therefore derepresses ompG expression.},

  abstract = {Outer membrane protein G (OmpG) is a non-selective porin from Escherichia coli. OmpG is a monomer, which makes it unusual among porins, and suggests that it may be useful in biotechnology. In planar lipid bilayers, individual OmpG pores reconstituted by insertion from detergent exhibit pronounced asymmetry in current-voltage relationships and voltage-dependent gating. Here, this asymmetry is used to deduce the orientation of OmpG in the bilayers. We introduced two cysteines into the extracellular loops of OmpG. Cleavage of the disulfide bond formed by these residues significantly increases spontaneous gating of the pore. By adding DTT to one side of the bilayer or the other, we demonstrated that pores showing a quiet trace at negative potentials have a ``trans'' conformation (extracellular loops on the trans side of the bilayer), while pores showing a quiet trace at positive potentials have a ``cis'' conformation (extracellular loops on the cis side). With this knowledge, we examined the binding of a cyclodextrin to OmpG. When the cyclodextrin was presented to the extracellular face of the pore, transient multisite interactions were observed. In contrast, when the cyclodextrin was presented to the periplasmic face, a more stable single-site interaction occurred. Because the cyclodextrin can act as a molecular adapter by binding analytes, this information serves to advance the use of OmpG as a biosensor.},

Ribosome particles, directly pelleted and frozen into an NMR rotor, yield DNP signal enhancements on the order of {\textasciitilde}25-fold and spectra that exhibit narrow linewidths, suitable for obtaining site-specific information. We anticipate that the same approach is applicable to other high molecular weight complexes.},

The scheme exploits the avoided level crossing in spin pairs during an adiabatic amplitude sweep through the so-called HORROR recoupling condition. The advantages over presently used double-quantum filters are twofold. (i) The maximum theoretical filter efficiency is, due to the adiabatic variation, 100\% instead of 73\% as for transient methods. (ii) Since the filter does not rely on the phase-cycling properties of the double-quantum coherence, there is no need to obtain the full double-quantum intensity for all spins in the sample at one single point in time. The only important requirement is that all coupled spins pass through a two-spin state during the amplitude sweep. This makes the pulse scheme robust with respect to rf-amplitude missetting, rf-field inhomogeneity and chemical-shift offset.},

Here we present additions to the CcpNmr Analysis software package which enable easier identification of spinning side bands, straightforward analysis of double quantum spectra, automatic consideration of non-uniform labelling schemes, as well as extension of other existing features to the needs of solid-state MAS data. To underpin this, we have updated and extended the CCPN data model and experiment descriptions to include transfer types and nomenclature appropriate for solid-state NMR experiments, as well as a set of experiment prototypes covering the experiments commonly employed by solid-sate MAS protein NMR spectroscopists.

The 13C shifts are assigned with magic angle spinning NMR dipolar correlation spectroscopy in a single experiment and compared with data of singly labeled retinylidene ligands in detergent-solubilized rhodopsin. The use of multispin labeling in combination with 2-D correlation spectroscopy improves the relative accuracy of the shift measurements. We have used the chemical shift data to analyze the electronic structure of the retinylidene ligand at three levels of understanding: (i) by specifying interactions between the 13C-labeled ligand and the G-protein-coupled receptor target, (ii) by making a charge assessment of the protonation of the Schiff base in rhodopsin, and (iii) by evaluating the total charge on the carbons of the retinylidene chromophore. In this way it is shown that a conjugation defect is the predominant ground-state property governing the molecular electronics of the retinylidene chromophore in rhodopsin. The cumulative chemical shifts at the odd-numbered carbons (?\ensuremath{\sigma}odd) of 11-Z-protonated Schiff base models relative to the unprotonated Schiff base can be used to measure the extent of delocalization of positive charge into the polyene. For a series of 11-Z-protonated Schiff base models and rhodopsin, ?\ensuremath{\sigma}odd appears to correlate linearly with the frequency of maximum visible absorption. Since rhodopsin has the largest value of ?\ensuremath{\sigma}odd, the data contribute to existing and converging spectroscopic evidence for a complex counterion stabilizing the protonated Schiff base in the binding pocket.},

  abstract = {We present a computational method for finding optimal labeling patterns for the backbone assignment of membrane proteins and other large proteins that cannot be assigned by conventional strategies. Following the approach of Kainosho and Tsuji (Biochemistry 21:6273{\textendash}6279 (1982)), types of amino acids are labeled with 13C or/and 15N such that cross peaks between 13CO(i {\textendash} 1) and 15NH(i) result only for pairs of sequentially adjacent amino acids of which the first is labeled with 13C and the second with 15N. In this way, unambiguous sequence-specific assignments can be obtained for unique pairs of amino acids that occur exactly once in the sequence of the protein. To be practical, it is crucial to limit the number of differently labeled protein samples that have to be prepared while obtaining an optimal extent of labeled unique amino acid pairs. Our computer algorithm UPLABEL for optimal unique pair labeling, implemented in the program CYANA and in a standalone program, and also available through a web portal, uses combinatorial optimization to find for a given amino acid sequence labeling patterns that maximize the number of unique pair assignments with a minimal number of differently labeled protein samples. Various auxiliary conditions, including labeled amino acid availability and price, previously known partial assignments, and sequence regions of particular interest can be taken into account when determining optimal amino acid type-specific labeling patterns. The method is illustrated for the assignment of the human G-protein coupled receptor bradykinin B2 (B2R) and applied as a starting point for the backbone assignment of the membrane protein proteorhodopsin.},

  abstract = {The accuracy with which distances can be measured using dipolar recoupling experiments in solid-state NMR is investigated. The relative precision of experiments in a three spin system versus an isolated spin pair is found to depend very strongly on the nature of the coupling Hamiltonian. The accuracy of distances measured in even the simplified three spin system is seen to be very poor for existing homonuclear recoupling Hamiltonians. This suggests that it would be difficult to exploit broadband homonuclear recoupling to measure geometrical information reliably in complex spin systems. These conclusions apply equally to both single-crystal studies and powder samples. In contrast, the presence of additional spins has marginal impact on the accuracy when the coupling Hamiltonians commute with each other, as in the case of heteronuclear recoupling. The possibility of creating such a Hamiltonian for homonuclear recoupling using a suitable rotor-synchronized pulse sequence is discussed.},

  abstract = {We report acquisition of diagonal-compensated protein structural restraints from four-dimensional solid-state NMR spectra on extensively deuterated and 1H back-exchanged proteins. To achieve this, we use homonuclear 1H?1H correlations with diagonal suppression and nonuniform sampling (NUS). Suppression of the diagonal allows the accurate identification of cross-peaks which are otherwise obscured by the strong autocorrelation or whose intensity is biased due to partial overlap with the diagonal. The approach results in unambiguous spectral interpretation and relatively few but reliable restraints for structure calculation. In addition, the diagonal suppression produces a spectrum with low dynamic range for which ultrasparse NUS data sets can be readily reconstructed, allowing straightforward application of NUS with only 2\% sampling density with the advantage of more heavily sampling time-domain regions of high signal intensity. The method is demonstrated here for two proteins, \ensuremath{\alpha}-spectrin SH3 microcrystals and hydrophobin functional amyloids. For the case of SH3, suppression of the diagonal results in facilitated identification of unambiguous restraints and improvement of the quality of the calculated structural ensemble compared to nondiagonal-suppressed 4D spectra. For the only partly assigned hydrophobin rodlets, the structure is yet unknown. Applied to this protein of biological significance with large inhomogeneous broadening, the method allows identification of unambiguous crosspeaks that are otherwise obscured by the diagonal.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of membrane insertion and folding of a \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel membrane protein has been studied using the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) as an example. OmpA forms an eight-stranded \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel that functions as a structural protein and perhaps as an ion channel in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. OmpA folds spontaneously from a urea-denatured state into lipid bilayers of small unilamellar vesicles. We have used fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and gel electrophoresis to investigate basic mechanistic principles of structure formation in OmpA. Folding kinetics followed a second-order rate law and is strongly depended on the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayer. When OmpA was refolded into model membranes of dilaurylphosphatidylcholine, fluorescence kinetics were characterized by a rate constant that was about fivefold higher than the rate constants of formation of secondary and tertiary structure, which were determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis, respectively. The formation of \ensuremath{\beta}-sheet secondary structure and closure of the \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel of OmpA were correlated with the same rate constant and coupled to the insertion of the protein into the lipid bilayer. OmpA, and presumably other \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel membrane proteins therefore do not follow a mechanism according to the two-stage model that has been proposed for the folding of \ensuremath{\alpha}-helical bundle membrane proteins. These different folding mechanisms are likely a consequence of the very different intramolecular hydrogen bonding and hydrophobicity patterns in these two classes of membrane proteins.},

Previously, the pH-gating conformations of the \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel forming outer membrane protein G (OmpG) from Escherichia coli have been solved. When the pH changes from neutral to acidic the flexible extracellular loop L6 folds into and closes the OmpG pore. Here, we used single-molecule force spectroscopy to structurally localize and quantify the interactions that are associated with the pH-dependent closure. At acidic pH, we detected a pH-dependent interaction at loop L6. This interaction changed the (un)folding of loop L6 and of \ensuremath{\beta}-strands 11 and 12, which connect loop L6. All other interactions detected within OmpG were unaffected by changes in pH. These results provide a quantitative and mechanistic explanation of how pH-dependent interactions change the folding of a peptide loop to gate the transmembrane pore. They further demonstrate how the stability of OmpG is optimized so that pH changes modify only those interactions necessary to gate the transmembrane pore.},

This resonance can be used for double-quantum filtering and measurement of homonuclear dipolar interactions in the presence of magic-angle spinning. The spin dynamics depend only weakly on crystallite orientation allowing good performance for powder samples. Chemical shift effects are suppressed to zeroth order.

The 13C relaxation data was obtained utilizing protein samples possessing an alternating 13C?12C?13C... labeling pattern for most enriched sites. When combined with partial deuteration, this labeling pattern provides for isolated 1H?13C IS spin pairs exhibiting dynamically interpretable relaxation behavior. Side chains were found to exhibit a far broader range of dynamics than have been previously characterized for main chain resonances. The dynamics of structurally buried aromatic and leucine side chains are interpreted in terms of correlated main chain-side chain torsional oscillations. Structural regions exhibiting millisecond dynamics were found to correlate strongly with the presence of side chain-main chain or bifurcated main chain hydrogen bonds. Nuclei around the active site disulfide that exhibit mobility in the millisecond range correspond closely to the set of nuclei whose chemical shifts are altered upon reduction. The transient conformation is interpreted in terms of enhanced reactivity due to strain at the disulfide linkage.},

The mechanism was based on X-ray structures revealed from crystals grown from solubilized OmpG at both neutral pH and acidic pH. To investigate whether these conformations represent the naturally occurring gating mechanism, we reconstituted OmpG in native E. coli lipids and applied high-resolution atomic force microscopy. The reconstituted OmpG molecules assembled into both monomers and dimers. Single monomeric and dimeric OmpG molecules showed open channel entrances at pH 7.5 and at room temperature. The extracellular loops connecting the \ensuremath{\beta}-strands that form the transmembrane \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel pore exhibited elevated structural flexibility. Upon lowering the pH to 5.0, the conformation of OmpG molecules changed to close the extracellular entrance of their channel. It appears that one or more of the extracellular loops collapsed onto the channel entrance. This conformational change was fully reversible. Our data confirm that the previously reported gating mechanism of OmpG occurs at physiological conditions in E. coli lipid membranes.},

  abstract = {The transition moments for the amide bands from beta-sheet peptide structures generally do not exhibit axial symmetry about the director in linearly polarized Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements on oriented systems. The angular dependences of the dichroic ratios of the amide bands are derived for beta-sheet structures in attenuated total reflection (ATR) and polarized transmission experiments on samples that are oriented with respect to the normal to the substrate and are randomly distributed with respect to the azimuthal angle in the plane of the orienting substrate. The orientational distributions of both the beta-strands and the beta-sheets are considered, and explicit expressions are given for the dichroic ratios of the amide I and amide II bands. The dichroic ratio of the amide II band, which is parallel polarized, can yield the orientation of the beta-strands directly, but to specify the orientations of the beta-sheets completely requires measurement of the dichroic ratios of both the amide I and amide II bands, or generally two bands with parallel and perpendicular polarizations. A random distribution in tilt of the planes of the beta-sheets does not give rise to equal dichroic ratios for bands with perpendicular and parallel polarizations, such as the amide I and amide II bands. The results are applied to previous ATR and polarized transmission FTIR measurements on a potassium channel-associated peptide, the Escherichia coli outer membrane protein OmpA, and the E. coli OmpF porin protein in oriented membranes.},

  abstract = {The use of a low-power two-pulse phase modulation (TPPM) sequence is proposed for efficient 1H radio frequency (rf) decoupling in high-resolution 13C solid-state NMR (SSNMR) under fast MAS conditions. Decoupling efficiency for different low-power decoupling sequences such as continuous-wave (cw), TPPM, XiX, and \ensuremath{\pi}-pulse (PIPS) train decoupling has been investigated at a spinning speed of 40 kHz for 13C CPMAS spectra of uniformly 13C- and 15N-labeled L-alanine. It was found that the TPPM decoupling sequence, which was originally designed for high-power decoupling, provides the best decoupling efficiency at low power among all the low-power decoupling sequences examined here. Optimum performance of the low-power TPPM sequence was found to be obtained at a decoupling field intensity (\ensuremath{\omega}1) of \ensuremath{{\sim}{\omega}}R/4 with a pulse flip angle of \ensuremath{{\sim}{\pi}} and a phase alternation between \ensuremath{\pm} \ensuremath{\phi}(\ensuremath{\phi} = \ensuremath{\sim}20{\textdegree} ), where \ensuremath{\omega}R/2\ensuremath{\pi} is the spinning speed. The sensitivity obtained for 13CO2-, 13CH, and 13CH3 in L-alanine under low-power TPPM at \ensuremath{\omega}1/2\ensuremath{\pi} of 10 kHz was only 5{\textendash}15\% less than that under high-power TPPM at \ensuremath{\omega}1/2\ensuremath{\pi} of 200 kHz, despite the fact that only 0.25\% of the rf power was required in low-power TPPM. Analysis of the 13CH2 signals for uniformly 13C- and 15N-labeled L-isoleucine under various low-power decoupling sequences also confirmed superior performance of the low-power TPPM sequence, although the intensity obtained by low-power TPPM was 61\% of that obtained by high-power TPPM. 13C CPMAS spectra of 13C-labeled ubiquitin micro crystals obtained by low-power TPPM demonstrates that the low-power TPPM sequence is a practical option that provides excellent resolution and sensitivity in 13C SSNMR for hydrated proteins.

  abstract = {MATCH (Memetic Algorithm and Combinatorial Optimization Heuristics) is a new memetic algorithm for automated sequence-specific polypeptide backbone NMR assignment of proteins. MATCH employs local optimization for tracing partial sequence-specific assignments within a global, population-based search environment, where the simultaneous application of local and global optimization heuristics guarantees high efficiency and robustness. MATCH thus makes combined use of the two predominant concepts in use for automated NMR assignment of proteins. Dynamic transition and inherent mutation are new techniques that enable automatic adaptation to variable quality of the experimental input data. The concept of dynamic transition is incorporated in all major building blocks of the algorithm, where it enables switching between local and global optimization heuristics at any time during the assignment process. Inherent mutation restricts the intrinsically required randomness of the evolutionary algorithm to those regions of the conformation space that are compatible with the experimental input data. Using intact and artificially deteriorated APSY-NMR input data of proteins, MATCH performed sequence-specific resonance assignment with high efficiency and robustness.},

Cross-peak development and experimental requirements for obtaining distances from the two-dimensional solid-state NMR spectra of two- and three-spin systems are discussed, and demonstrations are shown for thymidine-2,4-13C2 and l-alanine-13C3. Internuclear distances are derived by comparison of experimental cross-peak buildup curves with numerical simulations. In the three-spin system, indirect coherence-transfer mechanisms prohibit the interpretation of buildup curves as due to isolated spin pair interactions and limit the accuracy of some distance measurements. This 2D technique can also be used for spectral assignment, as demonstrated by an application to l-arginine\ensuremath{\cdot}HCl-U-13C,15N.},

The theoretical complications introduced by large homo- and heteronuclear interactions among the spins, as well as the amplitude modulation imposed by MAS, are explored analytically and numerically.

These TonB-dependent transporters are based upon a 22-stranded antiparallel \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel, which is notably asymmetric in its length. Here, site-directed spin labeling and simulated annealing were used to locate the membrane lipid interface surrounding BtuB when reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine bilayers. Positions on the outer facing surface of the \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel and the periplasmic turns were spin-labeled and distances from the label to the membrane interface estimated by progressive power saturation of the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. These distances were then used as atom-to-plane distance restraints in a simulated annealing routine, to dock the protein to two independent planes and produce a model representing the average position of the lipid phosphorus atoms at each interface. The model is in good agreement with the experimental data; however, BtuB is mismatched to the bilayer thickness and the resulting planes representing the bilayer interface are not parallel. In the model, the membrane thickness varies by 11 {\AA} around the circumference of the protein, indicating that BtuB distorts the bilayer interface so that it is thinnest on the short side of the protein \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel.},

In vitro, \ensuremath{\beta}-amyloid (A\ensuremath{\beta}) peptides form polymorphic fibrils, with molecular structures that depend on growth conditions, plus various oligomeric and protofibrillar aggregates. Here, we investigate structures of human brain-derived A\ensuremath{\beta} fibrils, using seeded fibril growth from brain extract and data from solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and electron microscopy. Experiments on tissue from two Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with distinct clinical histories showed a single predominant 40 residue A\ensuremath{\beta} (A\ensuremath{\beta}40) fibril structure in each patient; however, the structures were different from one another. A molecular structural model developed for A\ensuremath{\beta}40 fibrils from one patient reveals features that distinguish in-vivo- from in-vitro-produced fibrils. The data suggest that fibrils in the brain may spread from a single nucleation site, that structural variations may correlate with variations in AD, and that structure-specific amyloid imaging agents may be an important future goal.

Osmotic shifts and other changes in the solution environment may influence the structures and membrane properties of phospholipid vesicles (including liposomes, proteoliposomes and biological membrane vesicles) and hence the activities of membrane-associated proteins. Polar lipid extracts from Escherichia coli are commonly used in membrane protein reconstitution. The solution environment influenced the phase transition temperature and the diameter of liposomes and proteoliposomes prepared from E. coli polar lipid by extrusion. Liposomes prepared from E. coli polar lipids differed from dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol liposomes in Young's elastic modulus, yield point for solute leakage and structural response to osmotic shifts, the latter indicated by static light scattering spectroscopy. At high concentrations, NaCl caused aggregation of E. coli lipid liposomes that precluded detailed interpretation of light scattering data. Proteoliposomes and liposomes prepared from E. coli polar lipids were similar in size, yield point for solute leakage and structural response to osmotic shifts imposed with sucrose as osmolyte. These results will facilitate studies of bacterial enzymes implicated in osmosensing and of other enzymes that are reconstituted in E. coli lipid vesicles.},

  abstract = {In recent years, solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS NMR) has been growing into an important technique to study the structure of membrane proteins, amyloid fibrils and other protein preparations which do not form crystals or are insoluble. Currently, a key bottleneck is the assignment process due to the absence of the resolving power of proton chemical shifts. Particularly for large proteins (approximately \ensuremath{>}150 residues) it is difficult to obtain a full set of resonance assignments. In order to address this problem, we present an assignment method based upon samples prepared using {[}1,3-13C{]}- and {[}2-13C{]}-glycerol as the sole carbon source in the bacterial growth medium (so-called selectively and extensively labelled protein). Such samples give rise to higher quality spectra than uniformly {[}13C{]}-labelled protein samples, and have previously been used to obtain long-range restraints for use in structure calculations. Our method exploits the characteristic cross-peak patterns observed for the different amino acid types in 13C-13C correlation and 3D NCACX and NCOCX spectra. An in-depth analysis of the patterns and how they can be used to aid assignment is presented, using spectra of the chicken \ensuremath{\alpha}-spectrin SH3 domain (62 residues), \ensuremath{\alpha}B-crystallin (175 residues) and outer membrane protein G (OmpG, 281 residues) as examples. Using this procedure, over 90\% of the C\ensuremath{\alpha}, C\ensuremath{\beta}, C\ensuremath{'} and N resonances in the core domain of \ensuremath{\alpha}B-crystallin and around 73\% in the flanking domains could be assigned (excluding 24 residues at the extreme termini of the protein).},

  abstract = {In this Communication, we demonstrate the use of deuteration together with back substitution of exchangeable protons as a means of attenuating the strong 1H{\textendash}1H couplings that broaden 1H magic angle spinning (MAS) spectra of solids. The approach facilitates 15N{\textendash}1H correlation experiments as well as experiments for the measurement of 1H{\textendash}1H distances. The distance measurement relies on the excellent resolution in the 1H MAS spectrum and homonuclear double quantum recoupling techniques. The 1H{\textendash}1H dipolar recoupling can be analyzed in an analytical fashion by fitting the data to a 2- or 3-spin system. The experiments are performed on a sample of the dipeptide N{\textendash}Ac{\textendash}Val{\textendash}Leu{\textendash}OH, which was synthesized from uniformly {[}2H, 15N{]} labeled materials and back-exchanged in H2O.},

For decades, high-resolution structural studies on oligomeric \ensuremath{\alpha}B have been confounded by its polydisperse nature. Here, we present a structural basis of oligomer assembly and activation of the chaperone using solid-state NMR and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The basic building block is a curved dimer, with an angle of {\textasciitilde}121{\textdegree} between the planes of the \ensuremath{\beta}-sandwich formed by \ensuremath{\alpha}-crystallin domains. The highly conserved IXI motif covers a substrate binding site at pH 7.5. We observe a pH-dependent modulation of the interaction of the IXI motif with \ensuremath{\beta}4 and \ensuremath{\beta}8, consistent with a pH-dependent regulation of the chaperone function. N-terminal region residues Ser59-Trp60-Phe61 are involved in intermolecular interaction with \ensuremath{\beta}3. Intermolecular restraints from NMR and volumetric restraints from SAXS were combined to calculate a model of a 24-subunit \ensuremath{\alpha}B oligomer with tetrahedral symmetry.},

Solid-state NMR may have a crucial role in structural investigations of those proteins that do not easily form crystals or are not accessible to solution NMR, such as amyloid systems or membrane proteins. Here we present a protein structure determined by solid-state magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR. Almost complete 13C and 15N resonance assignments for a micro-crystalline preparation of the -spectrin Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain formed the basis for the extraction of a set of distance restraints. These restraints were derived from proton-driven spin diffusion (PDSD) spectra of biosynthetically site-directed, labelled samples obtained from bacteria grown using {[}1,3-13C{]}glycerol or {[}2-13C{]}glycerol as carbon sources. This allowed the observation of long-range distance correlations up to 7 {\AA}. The calculated global fold of the -spectrin SH3 domain is based on 286 inter-residue 13C{\textendash}13C and six 15N{\textendash}15N restraints, all self-consistently obtained by solid-state MAS NMR. This MAS NMR procedure should be widely applicable to small membrane proteins that can be expressed in bacteria.},

  abstract = {We observed and characterized two distinct signals originating from different pools of water protons in solid-state NMR protein samples, namely from crystal water which exchanges polarization with the protein (on the NMR timescale) and is located in the protein-rich fraction at the periphery of the magic-angle spinning (MAS) sample container, and supernatant water located close to the axis of the sample container. The polarization transfer between the water and the protein can be probed by two-dimensional exchange spectroscopy, and we show that the supernatant water does not interact with protein on the timescale of the experiments. The two water pools have different spectroscopic properties, including resonance frequency, longitudinal, transverse and rotating frame relaxation times. The supernatant water can be removed almost completely physically or can be frozen selectively. Both measures lead to an enhancement of the quality factor of the probe circuit, accompanied by an improvement of the experimental signal/noise, and greatly simplify solvent-suppression by substantially reducing the water signal. We also present a tool, which allows filling solid-state NMR sample containers in a more efficient manner, greatly reducing the amount of supernatant water and maximizing signal/noise.},

  abstract = {Stereo-array isotope labeling (SAIL) has been combined with the fully automated NMR structure determination algorithm FLYA to determine the three-dimensional structure of the protein ubiquitin from different sets of input NMR spectra. SAIL provides a complete stereo- and regio-specific pattern of stable isotopes that results in sharper resonance lines and reduced signal overlap, without information loss. Here we show that as a result of the superior quality of the SAIL NMR spectra, reliable, fully automated analyses of the NMR spectra and structure calculations are possible using fewer input spectra than with conventional uniformly 13C/15N-labeled proteins. FLYA calculations with SAIL ubiquitin, using a single three-dimensional ``through-bond'' spectrum (and 2D HSQC spectra) in addition to the 13C-edited and 15N-edited NOESY spectra for conformational restraints, yielded structures with an accuracy of 0.83{\textendash}1.15 {\AA} for the backbone RMSD to the conventionally determined solution structure of SAIL ubiquitin. NMR structures can thus be determined almost exclusively from the NOESY spectra that yield the conformational restraints, without the need to record many spectra only for determining intermediate, auxiliary data of the chemical shift assignments. The FLYA calculations for this report resulted in 252 ubiquitin structure bundles, obtained with different input data but identical structure calculation and refinement methods. These structures cover the entire range from highly accurate structures to seriously, but not trivially, wrong structures, and thus constitute a valuable database for the substantiation of structure validation methods.},

  abstract = {In mature HIV-1 virions, the 26.6 kDa CA protein is assembled into a characteristic cone-shaped core (capsid) that encloses the RNA viral genome. The assembled capsid structure is best described by a fullerene cone model that is made up from a hexameric lattice containing a variable number of CA pentamers, thus allowing for closure of tubular or conical structures. In this paper, we present a solid-state NMR analysis of the wild-type HIV-1 CA protein, prepared as conical and spherical assemblies that are stable and are not affected by magic angle spinning of the samples at frequencies between 10 and 25 kHz. Multidimensional homo- and heteronuclear correlation spectra of CA assemblies of uniformly 13C,15N-labeled CA exhibit narrow lines, indicative of the conformational homogeneity of the protein in these assemblies. For the conical assemblies, partial residue-specific resonance assignments were obtained. Analysis of the NMR spectra recorded for the conical and spherical assemblies indicates that the CA protein structure is not significantly different in the different morphologies. The present results demonstrate that the assemblies of CA protein are amenable to detailed structural analysis by solid-state NMR spectroscopy.},

It has a large pore that is amenable to modification by protein engineering. The stoichiometry (Nb = 20) and selectivity (Kr = 0.7?1.2) of lipid?protein interaction with OmpG incorporated in dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine bilayer membranes was determined with various 14-position spin-labeled lipids by using EPR spectroscopy. The limited selectivity for different lipid species is consistent with the disposition of charged residues in the protein. The conformation and orientation (?-strand tilt and ?-barrel order parameters) of OmpG in disaturated phosphatidylcholines of odd and even chain lengths from C(12:0) to C(17:0) was determined from polarized infrared spectroscopy of the amide I and amide II bands. A discontinuity in the protein orientation (deduced from the ?-barrel order parameters) is observed at the point of hydrophobic matching of the protein with lipid chain length. Compared with smaller (OmpA; n? = 8) and larger (FhuA; n? = 22) monomeric E. coli outer membrane proteins, the stoichiometry of motionally restricted lipids increases linearly with the number of ?-strands, the tilt (? ? 44{\textdegree}) of the ?-strands is comparable for the three proteins, and the order parameter of the ?-barrel increases regularly with n?. These systematic features of the integration of monomeric ?-barrel proteins in lipid membranes could be useful for characterizing outer membrane proteins of unknown structure.},

The dependence of a in fluid phospholipid bilayer membranes on the C-atom position, n, of the nitroxide in the sn-2 chain of a spin-labeled diacyl glycerophospholipid therefore determines the transmembrane polarity profile. The polarity variation in phospholipid membranes, with and without equimolar cholesterol, is characterized by a sigmoidal, trough-like profile of the form \{1 + exp {[}(n - no)/\ensuremath{\lambda}{]}\}-1, where n = no is the point of maximum gradient, or polarity midpoint, beyond which the free energy of permeation decreases linearly with n, on a characteristic length-scale, \ensuremath{\lambda}. Integration over this profile yields a corresponding expression for the permeability barrier to polar solutes. For fluid membranes without cholesterol, no \ensuremath{\approx} 8 and \ensuremath{\lambda} \ensuremath{\approx} 0.5{\textendash}1 CH2 units, and the permeability barrier introduces an additional diffusive resistance that is equivalent to increasing the effective membrane thickness by 35{\textendash}80\%, depending on the lipid. For membranes containing equimolar cholesterol, no \ensuremath{\approx} 9{\textendash}10, and the total change in polarity is greater than for membranes without cholesterol, increasing the permeability barrier by a factor of 2, whereas the decay length remains similar. The permeation of oxygen into fluid lipid membranes (determined by spin-label relaxation enhancements) displays a profile similar to that of the transmembrane polarity but of opposite sense. For fluid membranes without cholesterol no \ensuremath{\approx} 8 and \ensuremath{\lambda} \ensuremath{\approx} 1 CH2 units, also for oxygen. The permeation profile for polar paramagnetic ion complexes is closer to a single exponential decay, i.e., no lies outside the acyl-chain region of the membrane. These results are relevant not only to the permeation of water and polar solutes into membranes and their permeabilities, but also to depth determinations of site-specifically spin-labeled protein residues by using paramagnetic relaxation agents.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses two forms of spectroscopy, spin-label electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy that are particularly well adapted to membrane and ion channel studies. FTIR is a branch of vibrational spectroscopy, whereas spin label ESR is a form of magnetic resonance. These two techniques are capable of giving complementary structural and dynamic information and have the advantage that, unlike visible, fluorescence, or UV spectroscopy, they are insensitive to opaque or highly scattering particulate samples. The requirements for the quantity of sample are similar in both cases. Neither has the high sensitivity of, for example, fluorescence spectroscopy, but both have specific advantages in terms of the detailed information that may be obtained. In general, quantities in excess of 100 \ensuremath{\mu}g will be required, although higher sensitivity can be achieved by using attenuated total reflection techniques in infrared spectroscopy and loop-gap resonators, coupled with microwave preamplifiers, in the case of spin-label ESR spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {The machinery used by the cell to perform essential biological processes is made up of large molecular assemblies. One such complex, the proteasome, is the central molecular machine for removal of damaged and misfolded proteins from the cell. Here we show that for the 670-kilodalton 20S proteasome core particle it is possible to overcome the molecular weight limitations that have traditionally hampered quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies of such large systems. This is achieved by using an isotope labelling scheme where isoleucine, leucine and valine methyls are protonated in an otherwise highly deuterated background in concert with experiments that preserve the lifetimes of the resulting NMR signals. The methodology has been applied to the 20S core particle to reveal functionally important motions and interactions by recording spectra on complexes with molecular weights of up to a megadalton. Our results establish that NMR spectroscopy can provide detailed insight into supra-molecular structures over an order of magnitude larger than those routinely studied using methodology that is generally applicable.},

The Fourier transform of the echo envelope is a sharp spectrum from which the effects of anisotropy have been removed. The Fourier transform of the echo shape contains information concerning the anisotropies: This information can be extracted by a moment analysis. The effects of localized homonuclear spin{\textendash}spin interactions are to convert the ''isotropic'' spectrum into a characteristic powder pattern. Second order quadrupole coupling produces a similar effect. It is shown in this case that the usual second-order level shifts cannot be used to calculated this pattern, which must be described by a proper average Hamiltonian theory. Finally it is shown that rotational spin echoes provide a convenient means of studying very slow random molecular rotations (\ensuremath{\tau} c \ensuremath{\lessequivlnt}1 sec).},

  abstract = {Dynamics are intimately linked to protein stability and play a crucial role in important biological processes, such as ligand binding, allosteric regulation, protein folding, signaling, and enzymatic catalysis. Solid-state NMR relaxation measurements allow researchers to determine the amplitudes, time scales, and under favorable conditions, directionality of motions at atomic resolution over the entire range of dynamic processes from picoseconds to milliseconds. Because this method allows researchers to examine both the amplitudes and time scales of motions in this range, they can link different tiers of protein motions in protein energy landscapes. As a result, scientists can better understand the relationships between protein motions and functions. Such studies are possible both with the primary targets of solid-state NMR studies, such as amyloid fibrils, membrane proteins, or other heterogeneous systems, and others that researchers typically study by solution NMR and X-ray crystallography. In addition, solid-state NMR, with the absence of tumbling in solution, eliminates the intrinsic size limitation imposed by slow tumbling of large proteins. Thus, this technique allows researchers to characterize interdomain and intermolecular interactions in large complexes at the atomic scale.In this Account, we discuss recent advances in solid-state relaxation methodology for studying widespread site-specific protein dynamics. We focus on applications involving magic angle spinning, one of the primary methods used in high-resolution solid-state NMR. We give an overview of challenges and solutions for measuring 15N and 13C spin?lattice relaxation (R1) to characterize fast picosecond?nanosecond motions, spin?lattice in the rotating frame (R1?), and other related relaxation rates for characterization of picosecond?millisecond protein motions. In particular, we discuss the problem of separating incoherent effects caused by random motions from coherent effects arising from incomplete averaging of orientation-dependent NMR interactions. We mention a number of quantitative studies of protein dynamics based on solid-state relaxation measurements. Finally, we discuss the potential use of relaxation measurements for extracting the directionality of motions. Using the 15N and 13C R1 and R1? measurements, we illustrate the backbone and side-chain dynamics in the protein GB1 and comment on this emerging dynamic picture within the context of data from solution NMR measurements and simulations.},

Orientations of the peptide and lipid chains were determined by polarized attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy. Lipid-peptide interactions with gramicidin A in DMPC bilayers were studied with different spin-labeled lipid species by using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. In DMPC membranes, the orientation of the lipid chains is comparable to that in the absence of peptide, in both gel and fluid phases. In gel-phase DMPC, the effective tilt of the peptide exceeds that of the lipid chains, but in the fluid phase both are similar. For gramicidin A in DMPS, DMPG, and DMPE, the degree of orientation of the peptide and lipid chains is less than in DMPC. In the fluid phase of DMPS, DMPG, and DMPE, gramicidin A is also less well oriented than are the lipid chains. In DMPE especially, gramicidin A is largely disordered. In DMPC membranes, three to four lipids per monomer experience direct motional restriction on interaction with gramicidin A. This is approximately half the number of lipids expected to contact the intramembranous perimeter of the gramicidin A monomer. A selectivity for certain negatively charged lipids is found in the interaction with gramicidin A in DMPC. These results are discussed in terms of the integration of gramicidin A channels in lipid bilayers, and of the interactions of lipids with integral membrane proteins.},

Finally, Rosetta structure calculations provide a general framework to integrate the different sources of structural information. Combining a 7.7-{\AA} cryo-EM density map and 996 ssNMR distance constraints, the structure of the type-III secretion system needle of Shigella flexneri is determined to a precision of 0.4 {\AA}. The calculated structures are cross-validated using an independent data set of 691 ssNMR constraints and scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements. The hybrid model resolves the conformation of the non-conserved N terminus, which occupies a protrusion in the cryo-EM density, and reveals conserved pore residues forming a continuous pattern of electrostatic interactions, thereby suggesting a mechanism for effector protein translocation.},

  abstract = {A double-zero quantum (DZQ)-refocused INADEQUATE experiment is introduced for J-based NMR correlations under ultra-fast (60 kHz) magic angle spinning (MAS). The experiment records two spectra in the same dataset, a double quantum{\textendash}single quantum (DQ-SQ) and zero quantum{\textendash}single quantum (ZQ-SQ) spectrum, whereby the corresponding signals appear at different chemical shifts in \ensuremath{\omega}1. Furthermore, the spin-state selective excitation (S3E) J-decoupling block is incorporated in place of the second refocusing echo of the INADEQUATE scheme, providing an additional gain in sensitivity and resolution. The two sub-spectra acquired in this way can be treated separately by a shearing transformation, producing two diagonal-free single quantum (SQ-SQ)-type spectra, which are subsequently recombined to give an additional sensitivity enhancement, thus offering an improvement greater than a factor of two as compared to the original refocused INADEQUATE experiment. The combined DZQ scheme retains transverse magnetization on the initially polarized (I) spin, which typically exhibits a longer transverse dephasing time (T2\ensuremath{'}) than its through-bond neighbour (S). By doing so, less magnetization is lost during the refocusing periods in the sequence to give even further gains in sensitivity for the J correlations. The experiment is demonstrated for the correlation between the carbonyl (CO) and alpha (CA) carbons in a microcrystalline sample of fully protonated, {[}15N,13C{]}-labelled CuII,\hspace{0.167em}ZnII superoxide dismutase, and its efficiency is discussed with respect to other J-based schemes.},

  abstract = {Metal ions are ubiquitous in biochemical and cellular processes. Since many metal ions are paramagnetic due to the presence of unpaired electrons, paramagnetic molecules are an important class of targets for research in structural biology and related fields. Today, NMR spectroscopy plays a central role in the investigation of the structure and chemical properties of paramagnetic metalloproteins, linking the observed paramagnetic phenomena directly to electronic and molecular structure.A major step forward in the study of proteins by solid-state NMR came with the advent of ultrafast magic angle spinning (MAS) and the ability to use 1H detection. Combined, these techniques have allowed investigators to observe nuclei that previously were invisible in highly paramagnetic metalloproteins. In addition, these techniques have enabled quantitative site-specific measurement of a variety of long-range paramagnetic effects. Instead of limiting solid-state NMR studies of biological systems, paramagnetism provides an information-rich phenomenon that can be exploited in these studies.This Account emphasizes state-of-the-art methods and applications of solid-state NMR in paramagnetic systems in biological chemistry. In particular, we discuss the use of ultrafast MAS and 1H-detection in perdeuterated paramagnetic metalloproteins. Current methodology allows us to determine the structure and dynamics of metalloenzymes, and, as an example, we describe solid-state NMR studies of microcrystalline superoxide dismutase, a 32 kDa dimer. Data were acquired with remarkably short times, and these experiments required only a few milligrams of sample.},

This paper describes the development of a set of software applications that use the Data Model and its associated libraries, thus validating the approach. These applications are freely available and provide a pipeline for high-throughput analysis of NMR data. Three programs work directly with the Data Model: CcpNmr Analysis, an entirely new analysis and interactive display program, the CcpNmr FormatConverter, which allows transfer of data from programs commonly used in NMR to and from the Data Model, and the CLOUDS software for automated structure calculation and assignment (Carnegie Mellon University), which was rewritten to interact directly with the Data Model. The ARIA 2.0 software for structure calculation (Institut Pasteur) and the QUEEN program for validation of restraints (University of Nijmegen) were extended to provide conversion of their data to the Data Model. During these developments the Data Model has been thoroughly tested and used, demonstrating that applications can successfully exchange data via the Data Model. The software architecture developed by CCPN is now ready for new developments, such as integration with additional software applications and extensions of the Data Model into other areas of research.

  abstract = {Spontaneous membrane insertion and folding of \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel membrane proteins from an unfolded state into lipid bilayers has been shown previously only for few outer membrane proteins of Gram-negative bacteria. Here we investigated membrane insertion and folding of a human membrane protein, the isoform 1 of the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (hVDAC1) of mitochondrial outer membranes. Two classes of transmembrane proteins with either \ensuremath{\alpha}-helical or \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel membrane domains are known from the solved high-resolution structures. VDAC forms a transmembrane \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel with an additional N-terminal \ensuremath{\alpha}-helix. We demonstrate that similar to bacterial OmpA, urea-unfolded hVDAC1 spontaneously inserts and folds into lipid bilayers upon denaturant dilution in the absence of folding assistants or energy sources like ATP. Recordings of the voltage-dependence of the single channel conductance confirmed folding of hVDAC1 to its active form. hVDAC1 developed first \ensuremath{\beta}-sheet secondary structure in aqueous solution, while the \ensuremath{\alpha}-helical structure was formed in the presence of lipid or detergent. In stark contrast to bacterial \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel membrane proteins, hVDAC1 formed different structures in detergent micelles and phospholipid bilayers, with higher content of \ensuremath{\beta}-sheet and lower content of \ensuremath{\alpha}-helix when inserted and folded into lipid bilayers. Experiments with mixtures of lipid and detergent indicated that the content of \ensuremath{\beta}-sheet secondary structure in hVDAC1 decreased at increased detergent content. Unlike bacterial \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel membrane proteins, hVDAC1 was not stable even in mild detergents such as LDAO or dodecylmaltoside. Spontaneous folding of outer membrane proteins into lipid bilayers indicates that in cells, the main purpose of membrane-inserted or associated assembly factors may be to select and target \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel membrane proteins towards the outer membrane instead of actively assembling them under consumption of energy as described for the translocons of cytoplasmic membranes.},

For rigid organic solids this is the case for MAS frequencies above approximately 40 kHz. It is shown that the quality of the decoupling as well as the sensitivity to frequency offsets can be improved compared to low-power continuous-wave decoupling. The decoupling efficiency is somewhat reduced compared to optimized high-power decoupling: in a peptide sample investigated at an MAS frequency of 50 kHz a loss of about 10\% in signal intensity for CH3 and CH groups, and of about 40\% for CH2 groups was observed. Taking into consideration, that the rf amplitude in the low-power XiX was about 15 times lower than in high-power XiX decoupling, such a reduction in line intensity is sometimes tolerable.},

The OmpG channel is a 14-stranded \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel, with short periplasmic turns and seven extracellular loops. Crystals grown at neutral pH show the channel in the open state at 2.3 {\AA} resolution. In the 2.7 {\AA} structure of crystals grown at pH 5.6, the pore is blocked by loop 6, which folds across the channel. The rearrangement of loop 6 appears to be triggered by a pair of histidine residues, which repel one another at acidic pH, resulting in the breakage of neighbouring H-bonds and a lengthening of loop 6 from 10 to 17 residues. A total of 151 ordered LDAO detergent molecules were found in the 2.3 {\AA} structure, mostly on the hydrophobic outer surface of OmpG, mimicking the outer membrane lipid bilayer, with three LDAO molecules in the open pore. In the 2.7 {\AA} structure, OmpG binds one OG and one glucose molecule as sugar substrates in the closed pore.},

  abstract = {Structure determination by solid-state NMR of proteins is rapidly advancing as a result of recent developments of samples, experimental methods, and calculations. There are a number of different solid-state NMR approaches that utilize stationary samples, aligned samples, or magic angle spinning of unoriented ?powder? samples, and depending on the sample and the experimental method they can emphasize the measurement of distances or angles, ideally both, as sources of structural constraints. Multidimensional correlation spectroscopy of low-gamma nuclei such as 15N and 13C is an important step for making resonance assignments and measurements of angular restraints in membrane proteins. However, the efficiency of coherence transfer predominantly depends upon the strength of the dipole?dipole interaction, and this can vary from site to site and between sample alignments, for example, during the mixing of 13C and 15N magnetization in stationary aligned and in magic angle spinning samples. Here, we demonstrate that the efficiency of polarization transfer can be improved by using adiabatic demagnetization and remagnetization techniques on stationary aligned samples, and proton assisted insensitive nuclei cross-polarization in magic angle sample spinning samples. The adiabatic cross-polarization technique provides an alternative mechanism for spin-diffusion experiments correlating 15N/15N and 15N/13C chemical shifts over large distances. Improved efficiency in cross-polarization with 40?100\% sensitivity enhancements is observed in proteins and single crystals, respectively. We describe solid-state NMR experimental techniques that are optimal for membrane proteins in liquid crystalline phospholipid bilayers under physiological conditions. The techniques are illustrated with data from single crystals both of peptides and of membrane proteins in phospholipid bilayers.},

These experiments are based on a sensitive constant-time format, in which homonuclear scalar couplings are utilized for polarization transfer, but decoupled during chemical shift evolution, to yield highly resolved indirect dimensions and band selectivity as desired. The methods therefore yield spectra of high quality that give unique sets of sidechain correlations for small proteins even at 9.4 Tesla (400 MHz 1H frequency). We demonstrate versions of the pulse sequence that enable correlation from the sidechain to the backbone carbonyl as well as purely sidechain correlation sets; together these two data sets provide the majority of 13C{\textendash}13C correlations for assignment. The polarization transfer efficiency is approximately 30\% over two bonds. In the protein GB1 (56 residues), we find essentially all cross peaks uniquely resolved. We find similar efficiency of transfer (30\%) in the 140 kDa tryptophan synthase (TS), since the relaxation rates of immobilized solid proteins are not sensitive to global molecular tumbling, as long as the correlation time is much longer than the magic-angle spinning rotor period. In 3D data sets of TS at 400 MHz, some peaks are resolved and, in combination with higher field data sets, we anticipate that assignments will be possible; in this vein, we demonstrate 2D 13C{\textendash}13C spectra of TS at 900 MHz that are well resolved. These results together provide optimism about the prospects for assigning the spectra of such large enzymes in the solid state.},

However, often amide protons cannot be back-exchanged sufficiently, because of a possible lack of solvent exposure. For such systems, using 2H\hspace{0.25em}excitation instead of 1H\hspace{0.25em}excitation can be beneficial because of the larger abundance and shorter longitudinal relaxation time, T1, of deuterium. A new structure determination approach, ``quadruple-resonance NMR spectroscopy'', is presented which relies on an efficient 2H-excitation and 2H-13C cross-polarization (CP) step, combined with 1H\hspace{0.25em}detection. We show that by using 2H-excited experiments better sensitivity is possible on an SH3 sample recrystallized from 30\hspace{0.167em}\% H2O. For a membrane protein, the ABC transporter ArtMP in native lipid bilayers, different sets of signals can be observed from different initial polarization pathways, which can be evaluated further to extract structural properties.},

  abstract = {We describe new correlation experiments suitable for determining long-range 1H{\textendash}1H distances in 2H,15N-labeled peptides and proteins. The approach uses perdeuteration together with back substitution of exchangeable protons during sample preparation as a means of attenuating the strong 1H{\textendash}1H dipolar couplings that broaden 1H magic angle spinning (MAS) spectra of solids. In the approach described here, we retain 100\% of the 1H sensitivity by labeling and detecting all exchangeable sites. This is in contrast to homonuclear multiple pulse decoupling sequences that are applied during detection and that compromise sensitivity because of the requirement of sampling between pulses. As a result 1H detection provides a gain in sensitivity of \&gt;5 compared to the 15N detected version of the experiment (at a MAS frequency of 13.5 kHz). The pulse schemes make use of the favorable dispersion of the amide 15Ns resonances in the protein backbone. The experiments are demonstrated on a sample of the uniformly 2H,15N-labeled dipeptide N-Ac-Val-Leu-OH and are analogous to the solution-state suite of HSQC-NOESY experiments. In this compound the 1H amide linewidths at 750 MHz vary from \ensuremath{\sim}0.67 ppm at \ensuremath{\omega}r/2\ensuremath{{\pi}{\sim}}5 kHz to \ensuremath{\sim}0.20 ppm at \ensuremath{\omega}r/2\ensuremath{{\pi}{\sim}}30 kHz, indicating that useful resolution is available in the 1H spectrum via this approach. Since the experiments circumvent the problem of dipolar truncation in the 1H{\textendash}1H spin system, they should make it possible to measure long-range distances in a uniformly labeled environment. Thus, we expect the experiments to be useful in constraining the global fold of a protein.},

  abstract = {Four new and complementary three-dimensional triple-resonance experiments are described for obtaining complete backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments of proteins uniformly enriched with 13C and 15N. The new methods all rely on 1H detection and use multiple magnetization transfers through well-resolved one-bond J couplings. Therefore, the 3D experiments are sensitive and permit relatively rapid recording of 3D spectra (1{\textendash}2 days) for protein concentrations on the order of 1 mM. One experiment (HNCO) correlates the amide 1H and 15N shifts with the 13C shift of the carbonyl resonance of the preceding amino acid. A second experiment (HNCA) correlates the intraresidue amide 1H and 15N shifts with the Ca chemical shift. This experiment often also provides a weak correlation between the amide NH and 15N resonances of one amino acid and the C\ensuremath{\alpha} resonance of the preceding amino acid. A third experiment (HCACO) correlates the H\ensuremath{\alpha} and C\ensuremath{\alpha} shifts with the intraresidue carbonyl shift. Finally, a 3D relay experiment, HCA(CO)N, correlates H\ensuremath{\alpha} and C\ensuremath{\alpha} resonances of one residue with the 15N frequency of the succeeding residue. The principles of these experiments are described in terms of the operator formalism. To optimize spectral resolution, special attention is paid to removal of undesired J splittings in the 3D spectra. Technical details regarding the implementation of these triple-resonance experiments on a commercial spectrometer are also provided. The experiments are demonstrated for the protein calmodulin (16.7 kDa).},

In the solid-state, such an effect would not be expected a prior, as the investigated molecules are immobilized. However, local motions induce fluctuations of the local fields experienced by the nuclear spins and, this way, are effective for relaxation. We demonstrate that protein dynamics can significantly influence the resonance line width in ultra high resolution MAS (magic angle spinning) solid-state NMR experiments. Averaging of the 15NH\ensuremath{\alpha}/\ensuremath{\beta} multiplet components as a consequence of 1H decoupling induces effective broadening of the 15N resonance. Application of TROSY type techniques that select only the narrow component of the multiplet pattern results in an increased resolution and, thus, will be of benefit for MAS solid-state NMR spectroscopy. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Membrane protein insertion and folding was studied for the major outer membrane protein of Fusobacterium nucleatum (FomA), which is a voltage-dependent general diffusion porin. The transmembrane domain of FomA forms a \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel that is predicted to consist of 14 \ensuremath{\beta}-strands. Here, unfolded FomA is shown to insert and fold spontaneously and quantitatively into phospholipid bilayers upon dilution of the denaturant urea, which was shown previously only for outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of Escherichia coli. Folding of FomA is demonstrated by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy, by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and by single-channel recordings. Refolded FomA had a single-channel conductance of 1.1 nS at 1 M KCl, in agreement with the conductance of FomA isolated from membranes in native form. In contrast to OmpA, which forms a smaller eight-stranded \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel domain, folding kinetics of the larger FomA were slower and provided evidence for parallel folding pathways of FomA into lipid bilayers. Two pathways were observed independent of membrane thickness with two different lipid bilayers, which were either composed of dicapryl phosphatidylcholine or dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine. This is the first observation of parallel membrane insertion and folding pathways of a \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel membrane protein from an unfolded state in urea into lipid bilayers. The kinetics of both folding pathways depended on the chain length of the lipid and on temperature with estimated activation energies of 19 kJ/mol (dicapryl phosphatidylcholine) and 70 kJ/mol (dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine) for the faster pathways.},

  abstract = {A novel porin, OmpG, is produced in response to a chromosomal mutation termed cog-192. Molecular characterization of cog-192 revealed that it is a large chromosomal deletion extending from the 3' end of pspA through to the 5' end of an open reading frame located immediately upstream of ompG. As a result of this 13.1-kb deletion, the expression of ompG was placed under the control of the pspA promoter. Characterization of OmpG revealed that it is quite different from other porins. Proteoliposome swelling assays showed that OmpG channels were much larger than those of the OmpF and OmpC porins, with an estimated limited diameter of about 2 nm. The channel lacked any obvious solute specificity. The folding model of OmpG suggests that it is the first 16-stranded beta-barrel porin that lacks the large external loop, L3, which constricts the channels of other nonspecific and specific porins. Consistent with the folding model, circular dichroism showed that OmpG contains largely a beta-sheet structure. In contrast to other Escherichia coli porins, there is no evidence that OmpG exists as stable oligomers. Although ompG DNA was present in all E. coli strains examined so far, its expression under laboratory conditions was seen only due to rare chromosomal mutations. Curiously, OmpG was constitutively expressed, albeit at low levels, in Salmonella, Shigella, and Pseudomonas species.},

We describe several 2D and 3D MAS correlation techniques for resonance assignment and apply them, at 7.0 Tesla, to 13C and 15N labeled ubiquitin to examine the extent of resonance assignments in the solid state. Both interresidue and intraresidue assignments of the 13C and 15N resonances are addressed. The interresidue assignment was carried out by an N(CO)CA technique, which yields Ni-C\ensuremath{\alpha}i-1 connectivities in protein backbones via two steps of dipolar-mediated coherence transfer. The intraresidue connectivities were obtained from a new 3D NCACB technique, which utilizes the well resolved C\ensuremath{\beta} chemical shift to distinguish the different amino acids. Additional amino acid type assignment was provided by a 13C spin diffusion experiment, which exhibits 13C spin pairs as off-diagonal intensities in the 2D spectrum. To better resolve carbons with similar chemical shifts, we also performed a dipolar-mediated INADEQUATE experiment. By cross-referencing these spectra and exploiting the selective and extensive 13 C labeling approach, we assigned 25\% of the amino acids in ubiquitin sequence-specifically and 47\% of the residues to the amino acid types. The sensitivity and resolution of these experiments are evaluated, especially in the context of the selective and extensive 13C labeling approach.},

Complete sequence-specific NMR assignments for the polypeptide backbone thus have been obtained. The 13C chemical shifts and the nuclear Overhauser effect data then resulted in the identification of the regular secondary structure elements of OmpX/DHPC in solution and in the collection of an input of conformational constraints for the computation of the global fold of the protein. The same type of polypeptide backbone fold is observed in the presently determined solution structure and the previously reported crystal structure of OmpX determined in the presence of the detergent n-octyltetraoxyethylene. Further structure refinement will have to rely on the additional resonance assignment of partially or fully protonated amino acid side chains, but the present data already demonstrate that relaxation-optimized NMR techniques open novel avenues for studies of structure and function of integral membrane proteins.},

The solution structure of OmpX in the DHPC micelles consists of a well-defined, eight-stranded antiparallel \ensuremath{\beta}-barrel, with successive pairs of \ensuremath{\beta}-strands connected by mobile loops. Several long-range NOEs observed outside of the transmembrane barrel characterize an extension of a four-stranded \ensuremath{\beta}-sheet beyond the height of the barrel.

The use of detergents in protein purification procedures hinders the formation of well-ordered crystals for X-ray crystallography and leads to slower molecular tumbling, impeding the application of solution-state NMR. Solid-state magic-angle spinning NMR spectroscopy is an emerging method for membrane-protein structural biology that can overcome these technical problems. Here we present the solid-state NMR structure of the transmembrane domain of the Yersinia enterocolitica adhesin A (YadA). The sample was derived from crystallization trials that yielded only poorly diffracting microcrystals. We solved the structure using a single, uniformly 13C- and 15N-labeled sample. In addition, solid-state NMR allowed us to acquire information on the flexibility and mobility of parts of the structure, which, in combination with evolutionary conservation information, presents new insights into the autotransport mechanism of YadA.},

  abstract = {Solid-state NMR has emerged as an important tool for structural biology and chemistry, capable of solving atomic-resolution structures for proteins in membrane-bound and aggregated states. Proton detection methods have been recently realized under fast magic-angle spinning conditions, providing large sensitivity enhancements for efficient examination of uniformly labeled proteins. The first and often most challenging step of protein structure determination by NMR is the site-specific resonance assignment. Here we demonstrate resonance assignments based on high-sensitivity proton-detected three-dimensional experiments for samples of different physical states, including a fully-protonated small protein (GB1, 6 kDa), a deuterated microcrystalline protein (DsbA, 21 kDa), a membrane protein (DsbB, 20 kDa) prepared in a lipid environment, and the extended core of a fibrillar protein (\ensuremath{\alpha}-synuclein, 14 kDa). In our implementation of these experiments, including CONH, CO(CA)NH, CANH, CA(CO)NH, CBCANH, and CBCA(CO)NH, dipolar-based polarization transfer methods have been chosen for optimal efficiency for relatively high protonation levels (full protonation or 100 \% amide proton), fast magic-angle spinning conditions (40 kHz) and moderate proton decoupling power levels. Each H{\textendash}N pair correlates exclusively to either intra- or inter-residue carbons, but not both, to maximize spectral resolution. Experiment time can be reduced by at least a factor of 10 by using proton detection in comparison to carbon detection. These high-sensitivity experiments are especially important for membrane proteins, which often have rather low expression yield. Proton-detection based experiments are expected to play an important role in accelerating protein structure elucidation by solid-state NMR with the improved sensitivity and resolution.},

  abstract = {A new indirect detection scheme for obtaining 15N/1H shift correlation spectra in crystalline proteins is described. Excellent water suppression is achieved without the need for pulsed field gradients, and using only a 2-step phase cycle. Careful attention to overall NMR instrument stability was found critical for obtaining the best resolution and sensitivity. Magnetic dilution by deuteration of the protein in combination with high-speed magic angle spinning produces 1H resonances averaging only 0.22 ppm in width, and in some cases lines as narrow as 0.17 ppm are obtained. In application to two different polymorphs of ubiquitin, structure dependent differences in both 15N and 1H amide chemical shifts are observed. In one case, distinct shifts for different molecules in the asymmetric unit are seen, and all differ substantially from solution NMR shifts. A gain of 7 in sensitivity makes the method competitive with solution NMR as long as nanocrystalline samples are available.},

  abstract = {Magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR (SSNMR) techniques have emerged in recent years for solving complete structures of uniformly labeled proteins lacking macroscopic order. Strategies used thus far have relied primarily on semiquantitative distance restraints, analogous to the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) routinely used in solution NMR. Here, we present a complementary approach for using relative orientations of molecular fragments, determined from dipolar line shapes. Whereas SSNMR distance restraints typically have an uncertainty of \ensuremath{\approx}1 {\AA}, the tensor-based experiments report on relative vector (pseudobond) angles with precision of a few degrees. By using 3D techniques of this type, vector angle (VEAN) restraints were determined for the majority of the 56-residue B1 immunoglobulin binding domain of protein G {[}protein GB1 (a total of 47 HN-HN, 49 HN-HC, and 12 HA-HB restraints){]}. By using distance restraints alone in the structure calculations, the overall backbone root-mean-square deviation (bbRMSD) was 1.01 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.13 {\AA} (1.52 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.12 {\AA} for all heavy atoms), which improved to 0.49 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.05 {\AA} (1.19 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.07 {\AA}) on the addition of empirical chemical shift {[}torsion angle likelihood obtained from shift and sequence similarity (TALOS){]} restraints. VEAN restraints further improved the ensemble to 0.31 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.06 {\AA} bbRMSD (1.06 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.07 {\AA}); relative to the structure with distances alone, most of the improvement remained (bbRMSD 0.64 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.09 {\AA}; 1.29 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.07 {\AA}) when TALOS restraints were removed before refinement. These results represent significant progress toward atomic-resolution protein structure determination by SSNMR, capabilities that can be applied to a large range of membrane proteins and fibrils, which are often not amenable to solution NMR or x-ray crystallography.},

Curve-fitting of OmpG in two pH conditions revealed the splitting and shifting of \ensuremath{\beta}-sheet signals upon opening of the channel. Besides secondary structure changes, there are also amino acid side chain signals that play active role in opening/closing of the channel. An interaction among positively charged arginines and negatively charged aspartic and glutamic acid residues is suggested upon closure of the channel while this interaction is abolished when the channel opens at higher pH.},

  abstract = {The 1H dipolar network, which is the major obstacle for applying proton detection in the solid-state, can be reduced by deuteration, employing the RAP (Reduced Adjoining Protonation) labeling scheme, which yields random protonation at non-exchangeable sites. We present here a systematic study on the optimal degree of random sidechain protonation in RAP samples as a function of the MAS (magic angle spinning) frequency. In particular, we compare 1H sensitivity and linewidth of a microcrystalline protein, the SH3 domain of chicken \ensuremath{\alpha}-spectrin, for samples, prepared with 5{\textendash}25 \% H2O in the E. coli growth medium, in the MAS frequency range of 20{\textendash}60 kHz. At an external field of 19.96 T (850 MHz), we find that using a proton concentration between 15 and 25 \% in the M9 medium yields the best compromise in terms of sensitivity and resolution, with an achievable average 1H linewidth on the order of 40{\textendash}50 Hz. Comparing sensitivities at a MAS frequency of 60 versus 20 kHz, a gain in sensitivity by a factor of 4{\textendash}4.5 is observed in INEPT-based 1H detected 1D 1H,13C correlation experiments. In total, we find that spectra recorded with a 1.3 mm rotor at 60 kHz have almost the same sensitivity as spectra recorded with a fully packed 3.2 mm rotor at 20 kHz, even though {\textasciitilde}20{\texttimes} less material is employed. The improved sensitivity is attributed to 1H line narrowing due to fast MAS and to the increased efficiency of the 1.3 mm coil.},

We report magic angle spinning NMR spectra of POPC and DPhPC membrane-embedded M218?60, both apo and in the presence of Rmt. Similar line widths in the spectra of apo and bound M2 indicate that Rmt does not have a significant impact on the dynamics or conformational heterogeneity of this construct. Substantial chemical shift changes for many residues in the transmembrane region support an allosteric mechanism of inhibition. An Rmt titration supports a binding stoichiometry of \ensuremath{>}1 Rmt molecule per channel and shows that nonspecific binding or changes in membrane composition are unlikely sources of the chemical shift changes. In addition, doubling of spectral lines in all of the observed samples provides evidence that the channel assembles with twofold symmetry.},
